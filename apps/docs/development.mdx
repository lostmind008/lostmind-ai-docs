<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Install the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. From `apps/docs`, run the local server:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3004
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3004`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. We run on 3004 to avoid conflicts. You can customize with `--port`:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Keep the CLI updated

Update the CLI if local output diverges from production:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

## Deployment

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
folder. Then Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone
https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

Repeat step 3.
