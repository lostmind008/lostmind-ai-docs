## Overview

There are two ways to build API docs here:

- OpenAPI specification files (`openapi.json`)
- MDX components for custom examples and guides

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [{ "bearerAuth": [] }]
```
