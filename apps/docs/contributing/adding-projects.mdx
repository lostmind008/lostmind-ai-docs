# Adding a New Project

Use this checklist to add projects in a consistent way.

## Steps

1. Create a folder under `projects/<project-slug>/` with:
   - `introduction.mdx`
   - `readme.mdx`
   - `architecture.mdx`
   - `development.mdx` (optional)
2. Add the pages to `mint.json` navigation under the appropriate group
3. Link to upstream sources for canonical details (README, ADRs, runbooks)
4. Keep frontmatter minimal: `title`, `description`, `category`, `lastUpdated`, `project`
5. Use shared sections and components (Cards, Info, Tip, Warning)

## Frontmatter Template

```mdx
---
title: "<Project Name> - <Page>"
description: "<short description>"
category: "<category>"   
lastUpdated: "<YYYY-MM-DD>" 
project: "<project-slug>"
---
```

## Section Template

```mdx
## Overview

One paragraph on the purpose and scope.

## Navigation

- [README](./readme)
- [Architecture](./architecture)
- [Development](./development)

## Key Details

Bulleted highlights specific to this project.
```
