# Contributing to LostMind AI Documentation

Thank you for helping improve our documentation. This guide explains how to add content, keep it consistent, and get changes reviewed.

## Principles

- Clarity first: write for new contributors and partners
- Source of truth: link to upstream project READMEs and ADRs when relevant
- Consistency: follow the shared section layout and tone

## Content Layout

Each project should include the following pages:

- Introduction: what the project is and why it exists
- Readme: the core usage and development summary (mirrors upstream README)
- Architecture: technical design and key decisions
- Development (optional): setup, scripts, and workflows

## Review Process

1. Open a PR in this repository
2. Ensure the docs build locally and links pass validation
3. Request review from the Docs team
4. Upon approval, changes will be deployed automatically
