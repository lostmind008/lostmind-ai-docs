3. **Current Time Stamp:** Use `mcp__time__get_current_time` to timestamp all analysis
4. **Web Research:** Use search tools for market research and competitive analysis

### 📁 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
Create a structured analysis in a `reviews/` folder with the following files:

1. **executive_summary.md** - 1-2 page investor-focused summary with clear recommendation
2. **technical_assessment_report.md** - Detailed technical analysis (architecture, code quality, scalability)
