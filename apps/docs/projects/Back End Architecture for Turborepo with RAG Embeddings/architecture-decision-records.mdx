# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) Template

## ADR-001: Next.js-First Architecture over Pure FastAPI

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: LostMind AI Technical Team  

### Context
LostMind AI requires rapid go-to-market for multiple AI-powered applications while maintaining long-term scalability. The team has existing FastAPI services but needs to balance development speed with performance requirements.

### Decision
Adopt Next.js-first architecture with selective FastAPI service retention for compute-intensive operations.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Pure FastAPI Architecture**: Separate FastAPI services for all backend operations
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Multiple specialized FastAPI services
3. **Hybrid Next.js/FastAPI**: Next.js for frontend + light APIs, FastAPI for heavy compute

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- 3-5x faster development for CRUD operations
- Single deployment target reduces DevOps complexity by 60-70%
- Unified TypeScript codebase eliminates interface synchronization overhead
- Simplified authentication and session management
- Better developer experience with hot reloading

**Negative**:
- Some performance trade-offs for async-heavy workloads
- Potential vendor lock-in with Vercel ecosystem
- Learning curve for team members specialized in FastAPI

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Retain FastAPI services for document processing, ML inference, and web crawling
- Implement provider abstraction patterns to avoid vendor lock-in
- Gradual migration plan to minimize disruption

## ADR-002: Turborepo over Nx for Monorepo Management

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: LostMind AI Technical Team  

### Context
Need to choose between Turborepo and Nx for managing the monorepo structure, considering team size, language requirements, and complexity.

### Decision
Use Turborepo for initial monorepo setup with planned evaluation of Nx at 10+ developers or when Python services exceed 30% of codebase.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Nx**: More mature, better polyglot support, advanced caching
2. **Lerna**: Legacy option, less actively maintained
3. **Rush**: Microsoft's monorepo tool, more complex setup

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Simpler setup and configuration
- Better integration with Vercel ecosystem
- Excellent TypeScript/JavaScript support
- Faster learning curve for team

**Negative**:
- Limited polyglot support compared to Nx
- Less advanced caching mechanisms
- May require migration as team grows

**Decision Criteria**:
- Migrate to Nx when:
  - Team size exceeds 10 developers
  - Python services exceed 30% of codebase
  - Complex build dependencies emerge

## ADR-003: PostgreSQL with RLS for Multi-tenancy

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: LostMind AI Technical Team  

### Context
Multi-tenant SaaS application requires secure data isolation between tenants while maintaining performance and simplicity.

### Decision
Implement PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) combined with application-level validation and audit logging.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Separate Databases per Tenant**: Maximum isolation, complex management
2. **Schema-based Isolation**: Good isolation, moderate complexity
3. **Application-level Isolation Only**: Simple but less secure

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Strong security through database-level enforcement
- Single database simplifies operations
- Cost-effective for small to medium scale
- Good performance with proper indexing

**Negative**:
- Potential performance impact at scale
- Risk of RLS bypass vulnerabilities
- Complex query patterns in some cases

**Security Measures**:
- Multiple layers of tenant validation
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security assessments
- Automated tenant isolation testing

## ADR-004: Google Generative AI SDK with Provider Abstraction

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: LostMind AI Technical Team  

### Context
Need to choose primary AI provider while avoiding vendor lock-in and maintaining flexibility for future provider changes.

### Decision
Use Google Generative AI SDK as primary provider with abstraction layer enabling future provider swaps.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **OpenAI Only**: Strong API, expensive at scale
2. **Anthropic Only**: High quality, limited model variety
3. **Multi-provider from Start**: Complex, increased overhead

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Cost-effective scaling with Google's pricing
- Strong multimodal capabilities
- Unified SDK for Google AI and Vertex AI
- Future-proofing through abstraction

**Negative**:
- Initial abstraction layer development overhead
- Potential Google ecosystem dependency
- Need to maintain multiple provider adapters

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
  generateText(prompt: string): Promise<string>
  embedDocument(content: string): Promise<number[]>
  searchRAG(query: string, context: Documen
