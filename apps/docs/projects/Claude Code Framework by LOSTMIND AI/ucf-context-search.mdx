# Command: /ucf-context-search

## Your Role: Context Search Specialist

This command searches through the Guardian's synthesized conversation history to find discussions about specific topics.

## Your Workflow

1. **Validate Input**: Ensure user provided a search term
   ```bash
   SEARCH_TERM="$ARGUMENTS"
   if [ -z "$SEARCH_TERM" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå Usage: /ucf-context-search <topic>"
       echo "Example: /ucf-context-search authentication"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Check Guardian Context**:
   ```bash
   ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
   PROJECT_CONTEXT="./.claude/context"

   if [ ! -d "$PROJECT_CONTEXT" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå No Guardian context found. Run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Search Conversation History**:
   ```bash
   echo "üîç Searching for: '$SEARCH_TERM'"
   echo "================================"
   echo ""

   # Search in chat history
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/chat_history.md" ]; then
       echo "üìù **Found in Chat History:**"
       grep -i -n -A 2 -B 1 "$SEARCH_TERM" "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/chat_history.md" | head -20
       echo ""
   fi

   # Search in context insights
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/context_insights.md" ]; then
       echo "üí° **Found in Context Insights:**"
       grep -i -n -A 1 -B 1 "$SEARCH_TERM" "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/context_insights.md"
       echo ""
   fi

   # Search decision timeline
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/decision_timeline.json" ]; then
       echo "üìã **Found in Decisions:**"
       python3 -c "
import json
import sys
search_term = '$SEARCH_TERM'.lower()
try:
    with open('$PROJECT_CONTEXT/decision_timeline.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    matches = []
    if isinstance(data, list):
        for item in data:
            if isinstance(item, dict):
                item_str = json.dumps(item).lower()
                if search_term in item_str:
                    summary = item.get('summary', 'Decision')
                    matches.append(summary)

    if matches:
        for i, match in enumerate(matches[:5], 1):
            print(f'{i}. {match}')
    else:
        print('No matches found in decision timeline')

except Exception as e:
    print(f'Could not search decisions: {e}')
"
       echo ""
   fi

   # Search conversation threads
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/conversation_threads.json" ]; then
       echo "üßµ **Conversation Context:**"
       python3 -c "
import json
search_term = '$SEARCH_TERM'.lower()
try:
    with open('$PROJECT_CONTEXT/conversation_threads.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Count total conversations containing the term
    count = 0
    if 'threads' in data:
        for thread in data['threads']:
            if isinstance(thread, dict) and 'content' in thread:
                if search_term in str(thread.get('content', '')).lower():
                    count += 1

    print(f'Found \"{search_term}\" in {count} conversation entries')

except Exception as e:
    print(f'Could not search conversation threads: {e}')
"
   fi
   ```

4. **Provide Search Results**: Present all matches found across Guardian context files

## Benefits

- **Quick Topic Lookup**: Find past discussions about specific subjects
- **Multiple Sources**: Searches across all Guardian context files
- **Context Preservation**: See how topics evolved over time
- **Immediate Results**: Works in current session without hooks

## Usage Examples

```bash
/ucf-context-search authentication
/ucf-context-search "project structure"
/ucf-context-search bugs
/ucf-context-search deployment
```

## Usage Notes

- Requires Guardian context (run `/ucf-onboard-project` first)
- Case-insensitive search
- Shows line numbers and context
- Searches all Guardian-generated files
