# Command: /ucf-agent-create

## Your Role: Agent Provisioner

Your task is to use the portable "Forge" engine to dynamically generate and provision a new, context-aware agent.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Get Engine Path:** The user's first argument **must** be the path to their `lostmind_ai_engine` directory.
2.  **Get Agent Description:** The user's second argument **must** be a quote-enclosed description of the agent's role.
3.  **Execute The Forge:** Run the `run_engine.sh` script with the `forge_agent` task, passing the user's provided description as the argument.
    ```bash
    bash "$ARG1/run_engine.sh" forge_agent "$ARG2"
    ```
4.  **Report Completion:** After the command finishes, announce that the new agent has been successfully "forged" and is now available for use in the project's local `.claude/agents/` directory.
