# CLAUDE.md — [Your Project Name]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of project purpose]
**Created**: [Date]
**Framework**: LostMind AI Universal Claude Framework

## CURRENT SDLC MODE: NOT SET
**Set**: [Mode not yet configured]
**Context**: Project initialized - set appropriate development mode

### SDLC MODE BEHAVIORS
Available modes:
- **IDEA**: Exploration and decision-making (no implementation)
- **DESIGN**: Architecture planning and technical specification
- **DEV**: Active development with full technical assistance
- **TEST**: Quality assurance and pre-deployment validation
- **PROD**: Production deployment preparation (maximum quality standards)

**Use `/ucf-mode-status` to check current mode or `/ucf-mode-[idea|design|dev|test|prod]` to set mode**

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This file defines development standards, API verification protocols, and context preservation for this project, following LostMind AI Framework standards.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

- Plan Once, Scaffold Immediately, Verify Always
- API training data is NOT to be trusted — always search and validate
- No implementation without verified, dated documentation
- Sustain project context using breadcrumbs, explicit timestamps, and persistent memory
- Use Australian English consistently in all documentation and code

## API VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

NO advice, integration, or synthesis involving AI/ML/cloud APIs, SDKs, or frameworks may be actioned without a live, dated, multi-source verification.

**Verification Triggers**:
- Any model/SDK/service/framework name, API endpoint, package install
- Breaking/preview/deprecation notes, authentication methods, pricing/limits
- Version numbers, feature lists, migration guides, region info

**Verification Process**:
1. Search: "[Service] API documentation latest [Month Year]"
2. Search: "[Service] breaking changes [Year]"
3. Cross-check official docs, GitHub, developer portals, release logs (last 6 months)
4. Return only practices with stated verification date and source citation
5. Log status in API VERIFICATION block below

### API VERIFICATION BLOCK
```
Service: [Service Name]
Documentation: [URL]
Last Verified: [Date]
Current Version: [version]
Status: [Stable/Preview/Deprecated/etc.]
Breaking Changes: [Yes/No – Details]
Next Verification: [Date + 30 days]
```

## PROJECT STRUCTURE & CONTEXT

**Required Files**:
- PROJECT_MAP.md: Project summary, directory structure, API dependencies
- README.md: User-facing documentation
- CHANGELOG.md: API version and breaking change history

**Tech Stack** (to be populated during audit):
- **Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python]
- **Framework**: [e.g., Next.js, FastAPI]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL]
- **Code Style**: [e.g., Prettier, Ruff]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Jest, Pytest]

## PROJECT PROTOCOLS

### Project Brief
**Project Goal**: [A one-sentence summary of the project's purpose]
**Target Audience**: [Who is this project for?]
**Core Features**:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

### Technical Specification
*Will be populated during guided brainstorming session or audit process*

## PLANNING DECISIONS

**[Date]**: Initial project setup with LostMind AI Framework
- UCF framework installed with pull-based context retrieval
- Guardian integration configured for unlimited context memory
- [Add planning decisions with timing and API impact]

## CURRENT STATE

**Implementation Status**: [Current phase]
**API Dependencies**: [List with verification dates]
**Next Planning Session**: [Date]

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before any release, ensure:
- All APIs/SDKs verified within last 30 days (see verification block above)
- All TODOs reference planning sessions with dates
- Navigation links (Prev/Next/Parent) exist for major files
- Breaking changes documented with mitigation strategies
- Australian English used consistently
- API verification scheduled (calendar reminders)

## COMMUNICATION STANDARDS

- Write all documentation and code comments in Australian English
- State verification status with every API claim ("as of [date] …")
- Explain "why" for major design/architecture choices
- Flag unverified information, deprecated features, or experimental/beta functions

**Code Signature Example**:
```
// Using google-genai v1.0.12 as of 2025-09-20 (stable per docs; google-generativeai deprecates Nov 2025)
```

## LOSTMIND AI FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

### Guardian Context System
This project uses Guardian context synthesis for unlimited context memory:

**Pull-Based Context Commands**:
- `/ucf-context-summary` - AI-generated summary of recent decisions
- `/ucf-context-search <topic>` - Search conversation history
- `/ucf-context-decisions` - Chronological decision timeline
- `/ucf-context-insights` - Guardian AI-generated insights

**Guardian Management**:
- `/ucf-guardian-status` - Check context freshness and system health
- `/ucf-guardian-refresh` - Manually refresh context analysis

**Mission**: Ensure AI assistant maintains perfect continuity with past decisions a
