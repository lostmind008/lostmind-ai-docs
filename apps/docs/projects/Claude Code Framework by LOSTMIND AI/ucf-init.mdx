# Command: /ucf-init

## Your Task
When the user runs `/ucf-init`, you will:
1.  Confirm the directory is empty (or get `--force` confirmation).
2.  Copy the project template using the command: `cp -r ~/.claude/ucf_project_template/. .`
3.  **ENHANCED:** Copy SOP prompts locally: `cp -r ~/.claude/sop_prompts/ .claude/`
4.  Announce completion and suggest the next step is to run `/ucf-help` to see the exact command to define the project.
