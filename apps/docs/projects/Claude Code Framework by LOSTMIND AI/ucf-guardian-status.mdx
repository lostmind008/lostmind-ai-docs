# Command: /ucf-guardian-status

## Your Role: Guardian Status Reporter  

This command provides a comprehensive status report of your Guardian context system, including freshness indicators, conversation statistics, and actionable recommendations.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Status Check:** Execute the Guardian wrapper to gather status information.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    VENV_PYTHON="$ENGINE_PATH/.venv/bin/python"

    # Validate framework installation
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/guardian_wrapper.py" ]; then
        echo "❌ LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Validate virtual environment
    if [ ! -f "$VENV_PYTHON" ]; then
        echo "❌ Framework virtual environment not found. Please reinstall the framework."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Execute using framework's isolated Python environment
    "$VENV_PYTHON" "$ENGINE_PATH/guardian_wrapper.py" status
    ```
2.  **Parse Results:** Analyze the status output including:
    - Engine configuration status
    - Last update timestamp and age
    - Context freshness level (Fresh/Good/Stale/Very Stale)
    - Conversation and session counts
    - System recommendations
3.  **Format Report:** Present the information in a clear, actionable format
4.  **Provide Guidance:** Based on the status, suggest next steps to the user

## Status Indicators

### Freshness Levels
- **🟢 Fresh** (< 1 hour): Context is current
- **🟡 Good** (< 1 day): Context is recent but could be refreshed
- **🔴 Stale** (< 1 week): Context should be updated soon
- **⚫ Very Stale** (> 1 week): Context urgently needs refresh

### Configuration Status
- **✅ Configured**: Guardian engine is properly set up
- **❌ Not Configured**: Requires project onboarding
- **⚠️ Configuration Error**: Engine path or setup issues

## Expected Output Format

```
📊 Guardian Status Report
   Engine Path: /path/to/lostmind_ai_engine
   Last Update: Updated 45 minutes ago
   Status: success
   Conversations: 2201
   Sessions: 23  
   Freshness: fresh 🟢

💡 Recommendations:
   - Context is up to date
```

## Error Scenarios

Handle these common issues:
- **No Configuration**: Guide user to run `/ucf-onboard-project`
- **Engine Not Found**: Suggest reconfiguring or checking engine path
- **Status File Corrupted**: Recommend running `/ucf-guardian-refresh`
- **Permission Issues**: Provide clear error messages and solutions

## Notes

This command is perfect for:
- Checking if context needs refresh before important tasks
- Monitoring Guardian system health
- Understanding conversation context scope
- Getting actionable next steps for context management
