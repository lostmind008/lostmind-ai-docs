# Command: /ucf-mode-dev

## Your Role: SDLC Mode Manager - DEVELOPMENT Stage

This command sets the current project to **DEV MODE** - the active development stage where you're implementing features, writing code, and building functionality.

## Your Workflow

1. **Update Project Mode**: Set the current SDLC mode in the project's CLAUDE.md
   ```bash
   # Check if .claude/CLAUDE.md exists
   if [ ! -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       echo "❌ No .claude/CLAUDE.md found. Please run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Current CLAUDE.md**: Load the existing project configuration to preserve content

3. **Update Mode Section**: Add or update the SDLC mode section in CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## CURRENT SDLC MODE: DEV
   **Set**: [Current timestamp]
   **Context**: Active development and implementation phase

   ### DEV MODE BEHAVIORS
   Claude will focus on:
   - Creating all necessary files with proper structure
   - Implementing features with complete functionality
   - Handling dependencies and environment setup automatically
   - Including comprehensive error handling
   - Generating basic tests alongside code
   - Following all CLAUDE.md standards consistently
   - Using proper virtual environments and containers
   - Handling all technical complexity transparently

   **Full implementation mode - Claude fills all technical gaps**
   ```

4. **Environment Check**: Verify development environment setup

5. **Announce Mode Change**: Inform the user about the enhanced development capabilities

## DEV Mode Guidelines for Claude

When in DEV mode, Claude should:

**✅ AUTOMATIC BEHAVIORS (No need to ask):**
- Create all necessary files and directory structures
- Set up and manage dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Include proper error handling and edge cases
- Generate basic tests alongside implementation
- Use virtual environments for Python projects
- Handle imports and module setup correctly
- Follow project's coding standards and conventions
- Add comprehensive logging and debugging support

**🔧 TECHNICAL GAP FILLING:**
- Automatically handle technical complexity the user might not know
- Implement security best practices without being asked
- Set up proper configuration management
- Handle environment variables and secrets properly
- Include proper TypeScript types or Python type hints
- Add necessary middleware and utilities

**📝 CODE QUALITY:**
- Use Australian English in all comments and documentation
- Verify all API/SDK versions before implementation
- Include API VERIFICATION blocks in code comments
- Follow clean code principles
- Add meaningful variable names and clear logic flow

**🧪 TESTING INTEGRATION:**
- Create basic unit tests for new functions
- Include integration test structures
- Set up testing configurations (jest.config.js, pytest.ini)
- Mock external dependencies properly

## Expected Output

```
✅ Project mode set to: DEV
📋 Mode Context: Active development and implementation

🎯 DEV Mode Active:
   • Focus: Full feature implementation
   • Behavior: Code, test, configure, optimize
   • Technical complexity handled automatically

⚙️ In DEV mode, I'll automatically:
   - Create complete implementations with tests
   - Handle all dependencies and setup
   - Include proper error handling
   - Follow your quality standards
   - Fill all technical implementation gaps

Ready for development! What feature would you like to implement?
```

## Automatic Quality Standards

In DEV mode, Claude automatically ensures:

**Code Structure:**
- Proper file organization and naming conventions
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular and maintainable architecture

**Dependencies:**
- Verified API versions with current dates
- Proper dependency management
- Security-conscious package selections

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration test skeletons
- Proper test data management

**Documentation:**
- Inline code comments in Australian English
- API documentation with verification dates
- Clear README updates

## Mode Integration

This mode integrates with:
- **Guardian Context**: Development progress preserved across sessions
- **LostMind AI Standards**: Full compliance with API verification and quality
- **Virtual Environment**: Proper Python/Node.js environment isolation
- **Quality Philosophy**: Professional standards without over-engineering
- **Solo Developer Support**: Complete technical assistance

## Environment Setup

Claude will automatically:
- Check for and create virtual environments
- Install and manage dependencies
- Set up development configurations
- Verify environment variables and secrets
- Configure linters and formatters

When ready to move forward, use:
- `/ucf-mode-test` - Begin quality assurance phase
- `/ucf-mode-design` - Return to planning
- `/ucf-mode-status` - Check current mode
