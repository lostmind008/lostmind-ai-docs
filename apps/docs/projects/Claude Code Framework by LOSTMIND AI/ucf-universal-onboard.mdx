# Command: /ucf-universal-onboard

## Your Role: Universal Project Onboarding Manager

Universal project onboarding that automatically detects project type and configures LostMind AI Framework for unlimited context memory regardless of existing structure.

## Universal Compatibility

This command provides onboarding for ALL project types:
- ✅ **UCF Projects**: Enhanced with Guardian integration
- ✅ **Custom Claude Projects**: Bridge installation and adaptation
- ✅ **Fresh Projects**: Complete UCF installation with Guardian
- ✅ **Legacy Projects**: Migration and modernization

## Your Workflow

1. **Universal Detection**: Automatically analyze current project structure and type.
2. **Execute Onboarding**: Run dynamic integration system:
   ```bash
   ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
   VENV_PYTHON="$ENGINE_PATH/.venv/bin/python"

   # Validate framework installation
   if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/dynamic_integration_system.py" ]; then
       echo "❌ LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Validate virtual environment
   if [ ! -f "$VENV_PYTHON" ]; then
       echo "❌ Framework virtual environment not found. Please reinstall the framework."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Execute using framework's isolated Python environment
   "$VENV_PYTHON" "$ENGINE_PATH/dynamic_integration_system.py" onboard
   ```
3. **Report Configuration**: Display installed components, Guardian status, and next steps.

## Onboarding Features

The universal onboarding system provides:
- **Project Type Detection**: Intelligent analysis of existing project structure
- **Configuration Adaptation**: Automatic configuration for detected project type
- **Guardian Integration**: Setup of unlimited context memory system
- **Command Installation**: Universal command bridge setup
- **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive system functionality verification

## What Gets Configured

Based on your project type:

### UCF Projects (Enhanced)
- Guardian integration with existing UCF structure
- Enhanced commands with unlimited context memory
- Preserved existing sophisticated functionality
- Additional context analysis capabilities

### Custom Claude Projects (Bridged)
- Bridge commands in `.claude-setup-package/commands/`
- Guardian adaptation layer for custom structure
- Preserved existing custom command conventions
- Universal compatibility layer

### Fresh Projects (Full Installation)
- Complete UCF structure with Guardian integration
- All LostMind AI commands installed
- Guardian engine with unlimited context memory
- Auto-export and context synthesis setup

### Legacy Projects (Migrated)
- Modern UCF structure with backward compatibility
- Guardian integration with legacy preservation
- Command migration and enhancement
- Configuration modernization

## Guardian Integration

Automatic Guardian setup includes:
- **API Configuration**: Gemini API setup for unlimited context analysis
- **Storage Pattern Detection**: Intelligent Claude conversation access
- **Context Synthesis Setup**: Sophisticated JSONL parsing configuration
- **Purpose Analysis Engine**: Reasoning chain extraction and preservation

## Validation and Testing

Post-onboarding validation includes:
- **Command Functionality**: Testing all installed commands
- **Guardian Operation**: Verifying context synthesis capabilities
- **Project Compatibility**: Ensuring existing functionality preserved
- **Integration Health**: Comprehensive system health check

## Expected Outcomes

After successful onboarding:
- **Unlimited Context Memory**: Guardian system operational
- **Universal Commands**: All LostMind AI commands available
- **Sophisticated Analysis**: Advanced JSONL parsing and purpose analysis
- **Project Preservation**: Existing functionality maintained and enhanced

## Error Handling

If onboarding encounters issues:
- **Graceful Rollback**: Automatic rollback on configuration failures
- **Partial Success Handling**: Continue with successful components
- **Clear Error Reporting**: Detailed diagnosis and resolution guidance
- **Manual Configuration Support**: Fallback to manual configuration options

## Notes

This command requires no arguments and automatically adapts to your project structure. All sophisticated Guardian functionality is preserved while adding universal compatibility.
