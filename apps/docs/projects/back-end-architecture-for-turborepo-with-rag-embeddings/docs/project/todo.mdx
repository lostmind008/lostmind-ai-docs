# Backend Architecture Development Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze existing codebase and requirements
- [x] Read and analyze all uploaded Python scripts
- [x] Examine architecture documentation files
- [x] Extract RAG application from zip file
- [x] Identify core functionalities and patterns
- [x] Document current capabilities and limitations

## Phase 2: Design backend architecture and module structure
- [x] Design turborepo-compatible module structure
- [x] Plan Gemma embedding integration
- [x] Create service layer architecture
- [x] Design API interfaces
- [x] Plan database and storage architecture

## Phase 3: Implement core backend services with Gemma embeddings
