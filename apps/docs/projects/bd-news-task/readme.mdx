# BD-News-Task

## üìã Overview
Comprehensive news analysis and scraping project powered by the LostMindAI News Agent system.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### Core Components
- **LostMindAI-Scraper-NewsAgent-Ready4-Delivery/**: Main news scraping and extraction system
- **scouted-resources/**: Integrated tools and utilities from other projects

## üîç Scouted Resources Hub
This project includes a comprehensive collection of reusable tools and utilities scouted from existing projects to accelerate development and enhance capabilities.

**‚û°Ô∏è [Explore Scouted Resources](./scouted-resources/README.md)**

### Available Resource Categories
- **üìä Analyzers**: GitHub repository analyzers, file analyzers, concurrent processing engines
- **üï∑Ô∏è Scrapers**: Advanced web scraping utilities and orchestration patterns  
- **‚öôÔ∏è Processors**: Batch processing systems, data transformation pipelines
- **üõ†Ô∏è Utilities**: Context management, memory protocols, helper functions

### Quick Access
- **[Usage Guide](./scouted-resources/USAGE_GUIDE.md)**: Get started with imported tools
- **[Resource Inventory](./scouted-resources/inventory/resource_inventory.json)**: Complete catalog of available resources
- **[Subagent Task Briefs](./scouted-resources/inventory/subagent_task_briefs.md)**: Detailed analysis tasks for specialized agents

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies for scouted resources
pip install -r scouted-resources/requirements.txt

# Set environment variables (for GitHub analysis capabilities)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
```

### Basic Usage
```python
# Use imported file processing tools
from scouted_resources.processors.simple_file_analyzer import SimpleFileAnalyzer

analyzer = SimpleFileAnalyzer("news_data/", "analysis_output/")
results = analyzer.run_analysis()
```

## üìä Resource Integration Status

| Category | Resources Available | Integration Status | Priority |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Analyzers** | 3 tools | ‚úÖ Ready | High |
| **Scrapers** | 2 tools | ‚úÖ Available | High |  
| **Processors** | 2 tools | ‚úÖ Ready | High |
| **Utilities** | 1 tool | ‚è≥ Needs setup | Medium |

## üéØ Key Capabilities

### Enhanced Processing Power
- **378x performance improvement** with concurrent GitHub repository analysis
- **Batch processing** for thousands of news files simultaneously
- **Progress tracking** with visual progress bars for long-running tasks

### Advanced Analysis
- **Context memory** for maintaining analysis decisions across sessions
- **Evidence-based verification** rather than assumption-based analysis  
- **Multi-source orchestration** for complex data gathering workflows

### Intelligent Resource Discovery
- **GitHub repository discovery** for finding news APIs and tools
- **Tech stack detection** for understanding news organization infrastructures
- **Quality assessment** with anti-hype verification protocols

## üîß Development Workflow

### For New Development
1. **Check Scouted Resources**: Review available tools before writing new code
2. **Use Existing Patterns**: Leverage proven concurrent processing and analysis patterns
3. **Delegate Heavy Tasks**: Use subagent task briefs for comprehensive analysis
4. **Maintain Context**: Utilize context management tools for decision preservation

### For Analysis Tasks
1. **File Processing**: Use batch analyzers for large datasets
2. **Repository Discovery**: Use GitHub analyzer for finding relevant projects
3. **Context Preservation**: Use universal context resolver for memory management
4. **Progress Tracking**: All tools include progress monitoring capabilities

## üìö Documentation
- **[Main Scouted Resources Guide](./scouted-resources/README.md)**: Complete overview
- **[GitHub Analyzer Documentation](./scouted-resources/analyzers/github_analyzer_documentation.md)**: Repository analysis tools
- **[Universal Context Resolver](./scouted-resources/utilities/universal_context_resolver_documentation.md)**: Memory management
- **[Batch Processing Guide](./scouted-resources/processors/batch_file_analyzer_documentation.md)**: Concurrent file processing

## ‚ö° Performance Highlights
- **Concurrent Processing**: Up to 378x faster repository analysis
- **Batch Operations**: Process thousands of files with progress tracking
- **Memory Efficient**: Intelligent resource management and caching
- **Error Resilient**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## ü§ñ Agent Integration
This project is designed for seamless integration with multiple Claude Code agents:
- **Resource scouts** can easily discover and catalog new tools
- **Analysis agents** have access to comprehensive task briefs and documentation
- **Processing agents** can leverage proven concurrent processing patterns
- **Memory agents** can utilize sophisticated context management systems
