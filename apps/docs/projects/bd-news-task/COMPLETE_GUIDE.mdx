# The Universal Claude Framework (UCF) v4 - Complete Guide & Project Log

This document provides a complete overview of the Universal Claude Framework (UCF) v4, including its purpose, architecture, usage instructions, and the detailed design history of its creation.

---

## PART 1: QUICK START & USER GUIDE

This section covers everything you need to know to install and use the framework effectively.

### 1.1. Introduction

Welcome to the Universal Claude Framework (UCF) v4. This framework transforms your AI assistant into a disciplined, context-aware, and reliable software development partner, built on the latest, validated best practices for Anthropic's Claude Code.

It enforces professional workflows, automates quality control, and provides intelligent guidance for both new and existing projects.

### 1.2. Installation

1.  **Run the Installer:** Execute the installer script from the root of this directory to set up the user-level configuration in your `~/.claude` directory.
    *   `./install_ucf.sh`

2.  **Start Developing:** Once installed, you can create a new project directory and use the `/init` or `/audit` commands to begin working with your new AI development partner.

### 1.3. Core Concepts

*   **Two-Tiered Context:** The framework uses a `~/.claude/` directory for your global user preferences and a `<project>/.claude/` directory for project-specific rules. Project rules always win.
*   **Agent Personas:** The AI adopts specialized roles (Architect, Coder, Tester, Security Agent) to apply the correct expertise to each task.
*   **Model Tiering:** The framework automatically uses the best AI model for the job (e.g., Opus for architecture, Sonnet for coding) to optimize for both cost and performance.
*   **Automated Quality Gates:** A powerful hook system automatically lints and formats code *before* it's saved, forcing the AI to adhere to quality standards.

### 1.4. The UCF Commands

*   `/init`: Run this in a new, empty directory to bootstrap a project with the UCF.
*   `/audit`: Run this in an existing codebase. It scans your project, identifies the tech stack, and creates a tailored UCF configuration for it.
*   `/help`: Run this anytime you're unsure what to do next. It provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions.

### 1.5. The Development Workflow

The UCF enforces a professional, step-by-step workflow:

1.  **Goal:** You provide a high-level goal.
2.  **Plan:** The **Architect** proposes a detailed plan.
3.  **Team Review:** The AI automatically reviews its own plan from multiple perspectives (Tester, Coder, Security) to find flaws early.
4.  **Approval:** You review the plan and the feedback, then give your approval.
5.  **TDD & Implementation:** The **Tester** and **Coder** work in a loop to build the feature.
6.  **Verification:** The AI runs all tests and quality checks.
7.  **Finalize:** The AI documents the code and updates its project map.

## PART 2: FRAMEWORK CONTENTS

This section details the contents of the final deliverable directory.

*   `UCF_V4_USER_SETUP/`
    *   This is the **user-level framework**. The `install_ucf.sh` script will copy the contents of this directory to `~/.claude`. It contains your global settings, default agent, custom commands, and hooks.

*   `UCF_V4_PROJECT_TEMPLATE/`
    *   This is the **project-level framework template**. The `/init` and `/audit` commands use this as a source to create the `.claude` directory inside your projects.

*   `install_ucf.sh`
    *   The installation script.

*   `Perplexity Research output/`
    *   Contains the raw, detailed research documents that were used to validate and refine the `v4` design of this framework.

*   `FRAMEWORK_EVOLUTION_LOG.md`
    *   The historical design document for v1 and v2 of the framework (also included below for completeness).

## PART 3: FRAMEWORK DESIGN & EVOLUTION LOG (HISTORICAL)

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the design process that led to the final v4 framework, including the initial architecture, research findings, and the cross-analysis that prompted the iterative improvements.

### 3.1. Initial `v1` Architecture

The `v1` framework was designed around a two-tiered context system: a User-Level setup (`~/.claude/`) for global preferences and a Project-Level setup (`<project>/.claude/`) for project-specific rules. It was composed of four main logical components: Protocols, Personas, State, and Workflow/Setup tools.

### 3.2. Research Findings: Official Claude CLI Functionality

A targeted investigation into the official Anthropic Claude CLI ("Claude Code") documentation yielded the following key findings:
*   Configuration is handled by `settings.json` files.
*   A single `CLAUDE.md` file is the primary project context source.
*   Custom commands are `.md` files in a `.claude/commands/` directory.
*   Hooks are triggered by `settings.json` and execute shell commands.

### 3.3. Cross-Analysis: `v1` vs. Official Documentation

The analysis revealed se
