PR_TITLE="docs: sync repository guidance with canonical source of truth"

PR_BODY='## Summary
- designate `docs/project/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md` as the authoritative status document and capture the visitor-token roadmap
- point README, AGENTS, and CLAUDE guidance back to that source to prevent drift
- downgrade overstated "production-ready" claims in project map, services, and packages overviews to match the current repo state
- flag historical/aspirational docs (progress update, audit report, SaaS launch pathway, Turborepo analysis) and link them to the canonical status page
- add LOCAL_COMMANDS.txt to .gitignore so local helper instructions stay untracked

## Testing
- pnpm lint
- pnpm type-check
- git status (clean after commit)
'
