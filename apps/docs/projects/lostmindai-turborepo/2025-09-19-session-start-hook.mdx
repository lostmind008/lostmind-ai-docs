> You didn't commit all the changes from phase 6 after you found that you missed infra in original first review..check the conversation log and think harder and use sequentialthinking

✻ Thinking…

  You're absolutely right! I need to check the conversation history carefully. Let me think through this:

  1. I completed Phase 6 initially with infrastructure analysis
  2. User pointed out that I missed the "infra" folder and asked me to include both "infra" and "infrastructure" 
  3. I discovered the infra/terraform/gcp/ directory with extensive Terraform configuration
  4. I updated the Phase 6 analysis file (06_infrastructure_analysis.md) with the Terraform findings
  5. BUT - I never committed these changes! I only updated the file but didn't create a git commit

  The user is correct - I need to commit the Phase 6 updates before continuing with Phase 8. Let me check the current git status and commit the updated Phase 6 analysis that includes the
   Terraform infrastructure findings.

⏺ sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking (MCP)(thought: "Let me carefully review what happened with Phase 6. I initially completed Phase 6 infrastructure analysis, but then the user

  Yes, that's exactly right. I need to commit the changes from Phase 6 where I added the Terraform infrastructure analysis to the 06_infrastructure_analysis.md file. Let me chec
