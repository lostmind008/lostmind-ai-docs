### Technical Details

#### Task Management Implementation

```bash
# Core functionality
- Task file discovery and analysis
- Status validation and reporting
- Automated cleanup procedures
- Format validation and error reporting
- Statistics generation and aging reports
```

#### TypeScript Standards

```typescript
// Before (causing errors)
{
  "extends": "@lostmind/config/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2022", "dom"] // ‚ùå DUPLICATE
  }
}

// After (proper inheritance)
{
  "extends": "@lostmind/config/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ‚úÖ Inherits lib from base config
  }
}
```

#### File Organization Standards

```
‚úÖ CORRECT:
apps/ask/tasks01.md
packages/ui/tasks01.md
docs/tasks01.md

‚ùå INCORRECT:
tasks02.md (in root)
task-list.md (generic naming)
```

#### Development Standards Validation

```bash
# Automated checks
- Task file accumulation monitoring
- CLAUDE.md freshness validation
- TypeScript co
