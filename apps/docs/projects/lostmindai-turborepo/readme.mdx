# LostMind AI Monorepo

Production-ready AI-powered SaaS platform built with Next.js 15, Turborepo, and FastAPI.

> 📌 **Source of truth:** [docs/project/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md](./docs/project/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md) is the canonical status document. Update it first whenever scope or implementation changes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19 Stable, TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for compute-intensive tasks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM and Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Auth.js v5 with Google OAuth
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **AI**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Next.js), Google Cloud Run (FastAPI)
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces

## 🛠️ Development Tools & Enhancements

### **Task Management System**

- **Automated task lifecycle management** with status tracking (🟢 Active, ✅ Completed, 🔄 Blocked)
- **Task cleanup automation** prevents accumulation of completed work
- **Smart task auditing** with `pnpm run tasks:audit`
- **Format validation** ensures consistent task file structure

### **TypeScript Configuration Standards**

- **Inheritance-aware configuration** prevents duplicate lib entries
- **Monorepo-specific patterns** for package organization
- **Automated validation** catches common configuration issues
- **Clear inheritance guidelines** for all package configurations

### **File Organization Automation**

- **Standardized directory structures** for apps, packages, and services
- **Naming convention enforcement** for components, tests, and documentation
- **Location validation** prevents files in incorrect directories
- **Automated cleanup** maintains project structure integrity

```bash
# Task management commands
pnpm run tasks:audit      # Analyze all task files
pnpm run tasks:cleanup    # Remove completed tasks
pnpm run tasks:status     # Show statistics
pnpm run tasks:validate   # Check format compliance
```

### **AI Development Memory System**

- **CLAUDE.md** serves as comprehensive project memory file
- **Context preservation** across development sessions
- **Pattern recognition** for consistent code organization
- **Standards enforcement** for TypeScript and file structure

**📖 [View CLAUDE.md for complete AI development guidelines](./CLAUDE.md)**

## Project Structure Overview

For the live directory snapshot, visit the [Current Project State](./docs/project/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md#-repository-structure-current). Highlights below mirror that file:

### Implemented foundations

- `apps/ask` — Orb experience scaffold (UI locked to current production experience, security upgrades in flight)
- `apps/marketing` — Marketing shell prepared for redesign
- `packages/*` — Shared libraries (`config`, `ui`, `db`, `auth`, `ai-clients`, `billing`)
- `services/ai-compute` — FastAPI service with IAM hooks and Redis rate limiting (needs production hardening)
- `docker-compose.yml` — Local stack for Postgres, Redis, Next.js apps, FastAPI

### Planned (not yet shipped)

- Additional apps: `private-docs`, `chatcrawler`, `justdropit`, `admin`
- Additional packages: `security`, `rag`, `utils`
- Additional services: `document-processor`, `crawler-engine`, `security-monitor`

### 📖 Directory Documentation

Each directory contains its own README.md with specific implementation details:
