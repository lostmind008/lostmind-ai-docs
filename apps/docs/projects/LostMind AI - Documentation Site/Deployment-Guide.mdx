# Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the backend intelligence services using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube, Docker Desktop, or a cloud provider)
- `kubectl` command-line tool
- `helm` command-line tool

## Docker Deployment

### Build Docker Images

Navigate to the root of the `backend-architecture` directory and run the following command to build Docker images for all services:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Run Services with Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to run all services locally:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all services, including the API Gateway, RAG service, and analysis modules. The API Gateway will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Create Kubernetes Namespace

Create a dedicated namespace for the backend services:

```bash
kubectl create namespace backend-intelligence
```

### Deploy with Helm

We provide a Helm chart for easy deployment to Kubernetes. Navigate to the `helm` directory and run the following command:

```bash
helm install backend-intelligence ./helm/backend-intelligence --namespace backend-intelligence
```

This will deploy all services, create necessary resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps), and expose the API Gateway through a LoadBalancer service.

### Accessing the API

To get the external IP address of the API Gateway, run:

```bash
kubectl get services -n backend-intelligence
```

The API will be available at `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:8000`.

## Configuration

Configuration for all services is managed through environment variables. You can customize the configuration by creating a `.env` file in the root of the `backend-architecture` directory. Refer to the `config.py` file in each service package for available configuration options.

## Monitoring

We provide a Grafana dashboard for monitoring the health and performance of all services. To access the dashboard, forward the Grafana port:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 8080:3000 -n backend-intelligence
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. The default credentials are `admin/admin`.
