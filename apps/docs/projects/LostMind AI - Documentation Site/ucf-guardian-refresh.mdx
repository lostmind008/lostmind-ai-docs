# Command: /ucf-guardian-refresh

## Your Role: Guardian Context Manager

This command refreshes your project's conversation context using The Guardian system. It automatically detects the engine configuration and updates all context files with the latest conversation data.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Auto-Detection:** The system automatically detects the Guardian engine at the global installation location.
2.  **Execute Refresh:** Run the Guardian wrapper to update context with latest conversations.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/guardian_wrapper.py" ]; then
        echo "❌ LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi
    python3 "$ENGINE_PATH/guardian_wrapper.py" refresh
    ```
3.  **Report Results:** Display the refresh results including conversation counts, session statistics, and any errors.
4.  **Status Update:** Inform the user about the updated context and available files.

## Expected Outcomes

After successful execution, the user will have:
- **Updated conversation context** in `.lostmind_ai_context/`
- **Fresh insights** from Gemini AI analysis
- **Current conversation statistics** (total conversations, sessions)
- **Timestamped status** for future reference

## Error Handling

If the refresh fails:
- Check if Guardian engine is installed at `~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/`
- Verify the project has been onboarded with `/ucf-onboard-project`
- Suggest running the framework installer if engine is missing
- Display clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

## Notes

This command requires no arguments and works automatically after initial project onboarding. It's designed for frequent use during active development to keep context current with ongoing conversations.
