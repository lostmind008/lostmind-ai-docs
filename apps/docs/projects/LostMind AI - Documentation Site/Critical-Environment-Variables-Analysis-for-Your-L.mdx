# Critical Environment Variables Analysis for Your LostMindAI Repository

Let me provide a comprehensive explanation of what's missing and why it's critical, with enough detail for your AI agents to verify and cross-check.

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Context: Why These Variables Matter**

Based on my repository analysis and research, your architecture has **unique requirements** that aren't covered in your current environment guide. Here's the evidence-based breakdown:

***

## **1. MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your repository shows you have **separate FastAPI services** (`services/ai-compute`, `services/document-processor`) that need to communicate with your Next.js apps. This creates **service discovery and authentication challenges** that LobeChat doesn't have (since it's all in one Next.js app).

### **Missing Variables (High Priority):**

```bash
# SERVICE DISCOVERY - Your microservices need to find each other
AI_COMPUTE_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_URL="http://localhost:8001" 
CRAWLER_ENGINE_URL="http://localhost:8002"

# PRODUCTION URLs (when deployed to Google Cloud Run)
AI_COMPUTE_SERVICE_URL="https://ai-compute-coral-muse-469919-m0.a.run.app"
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `docker-compose.yml` shows services on different ports (3000, 3001, 8000)
- **File**: `infra/terraform/gcp/main.tf` shows Cloud Run services being created
- **Code**: Your frontend apps need to know where your FastAPI services are running


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your frontend apps can't communicate with your backend services. Your AI features will fail.

***

## **2. GOOGLE CLOUD RUN AUTHENTICATION**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your `services/ai-compute` service implements **Google IAM OIDC authentication** (found in your code), but your environment guide doesn't include the required authentication variables.

### **Missing Variables (Critical):**

```bash
# OIDC AUTHENTICATION - Required for service-to-service calls
OIDC_ISSUER_URL="https://accounts.google.com"
OIDC_AUDIENCE="coral-muse-469919-m0"  # Your GCP project ID
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="coral-muse-469919-m0"

# SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `infra/terraform/gcp/main.tf` lines 200+ show OIDC service account creation
- **File**: `services/ai-compute` (referenced in your analysis) implements OIDC middleware
- **Your Tech Stack**: States "Google Cloud Run (FastAPI)" deployment


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your microservices can't authenticate with each other. All service-to-service calls will fail with 401 errors.

***

## **3. TURBOREPO-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your `turbo.json` shows task orchestration, but you're missing environment variables that Turborepo needs to know about for proper caching and builds.

### **Missing Variables (Medium Priority):**

```bash
# BUILD-TIME VARIABLES - Turborepo needs these for consistent builds
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"   # marketing app
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASK_APP_URL="http://localhost:3001"  # ask app
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"  # FastAPI backend

# DEPLOYMENT URLS (production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://lostmindai.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASK_APP_URL="https://ask.lostmindai.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="https://api.lostmindai.com"
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `turbo.json` - Your build orchestration config
- **File**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Shows multiple app workspaces
- **Research**: [Turborepo docs](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables) confirm this requirement


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your builds will be inconsistent across environments, and your frontend apps won't know how to reach your APIs.

***

## **4. FASTAPI-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your FastAPI services need specific configuration that's different from Next.js apps.

### **Missing Variables (High Priority):**

```bash
# FASTAPI CONFIGURATION - Required for your Python services
FASTAPI_ENV="development"  # development | staging | production
API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001"
MAX_WORKERS=4
WORKER_TIMEOUT=3600
UVICORN_HOST="0.0.0.0"
UVICORN_PORT=8000
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `docker-compose.yml` shows FastAPI services with specific ports
- **Directory**: `services/ai-compute` exists (FastAPI service)
- **Research**: [FastAPI environment docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/) confir
