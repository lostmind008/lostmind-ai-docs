# LostMind AI Framework - Comprehensive Fixes Plan

## Date: 2025-09-20
## Context: Fix critical architecture issues identified during debugging session

## Issues Identified

### 1. Hooks-Based Context Injection is Broken
- **Problem**: Automatic context injection via hooks is failing
- **Evidence**: `ERROR: Script failed: chat_exporter.py --auto-preserve`
- **Root Cause**: Timing issues, wrong project paths, unreliable injection
- **Impact**: Context preservation not working, hooks failing silently

### 2. Installation is Not Portable
- **Problem**: Framework depends on original clone location
- **Evidence**: UCF commands break if source directory is moved/deleted
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded paths to source instead of installed location
- **Impact**: Cannot distribute framework like proper software

### 3. Project Mapping Too Generic
- **Problem**: Shows ALL files including irrelevant package manager internals
- **Evidence**: 2MB PROJECT_MAP.md with noise like `.DS_Store`, cache files
- **Root Cause**: No intelligent filtering or framework-aware categorization

## Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Replace Push-Based with Pull-Based Context Retrieval ✅ APPROVED

**Remove:**
- Auto-preserve hooks that are failing
- Context injection hooks
- Session start/end injection attempts

**Add New UCF Commands:**
- `/ucf-context-summary` - Get AI summary of recent project decisions
- `/ucf-context-search <topic>` - Search conversation history
- `/ucf-context-decisions` - Show chronological decision timeline
- `/ucf-context-insights` - Get Guardian AI-generated insights

**Benefits:**
- Works immediately in current session
- No interference with Claude's native systems
- User controls when context is needed
- Cannot "break" silently like hooks

### Phase 2: Make Installation Truly Portable

**Current Broken Flow:**
```bash
git clone framework ~/some-path/
./install.sh
# UCF commands reference ~/some-path/
rm -rf ~/some-path/  # BREAKS EVERYTHING
```

**Fixed Portable Flow:**
```bash
git clone framework ~/temp/install/
cd ~/temp/install/
./install.sh  # Copies everything to ~/.claude/
rm -rf ~/temp/install/  # Framework still works!
```

**Implementation:**
1. Update `install_lostmind_ai_framework.sh` for complete self-contained copy
2. Fix all UCF commands to use `$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/` only
3. Remove any references to source directory
4. Test: install → delete source → verify functionality

### Phase 3: Improve Project Mapping Intelligence ✅ COMPLETED

**Enhanced categorization:**
- Framework-specific component detection
- Claude Code extension recognition
- Intelligent file filtering (no noise)
- Semantic understanding of project types

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Pull-Based Context Commands
- [ ] `/ucf-context-summary.md`
- [ ] `/ucf-context-search.md`
- [ ] `/ucf-context-decisions.md`
- [ ] `/ucf-context-insights.md`

### Task 2: Remove Problematic Hooks
- [ ] Delete auto-preserve hooks from `.claude/hooks/`
- [ ] Remove context injection hooks
- [ ] Keep only essential hooks (if any)

### Task 3: Fix UCF Commands for Portability
- [ ] Update `ucf-onboard-project.md` to use installed path
- [ ] Update `ucf-guardian-*.md` commands
- [ ] Remove hardcoded source paths from all commands

### Task 4: Fix Installer
- [ ] Ensure complete copy to `~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/`
- [ ] Update paths during installation
- [ ] No symlinks or references to source

### Task 5: Testing
- [ ] Clone to temp directory
- [ ] Run installer
- [ ] Delete temp directory
- [ ] Verify all UCF commands work
- [ ] Test context retrieval functionality

## Files That Need Modification

### UCF Commands (`.claude/commands/`):
- `ucf-onboard-project.md` - Update path references
- `ucf-guardian-*.md` - Update path references
- NEW: `ucf-context-*.md` - Create new context commands

### Framework Scripts:
- `install_lostmind_ai_framework.sh` - Make truly portable
- `lostmind_ai_engine/onboarder.py` - Already updated with smart mapping

### Hooks to Remove:
- Any auto-preserve or context injection hooks
- Session start/end hooks that inject context

## Testing Strategy

1. **Portable Installation Test:**
   ```bash
   mkdir /tmp/test-install
   git clone framework /tmp/test-install/
   cd /tmp/test-install/
   ./install_lostmind_ai_framework.sh
   rm -rf /tmp/test-install/
   # Test: Do UCF commands still work?
   ```

2. **Context Retrieval Test:**
   ```bash
   /ucf-context-summary
   /ucf-context-search "onboarding"
   /ucf-context-insights
   # Should work without hooks
   ```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Installation Independence**: Framework works after deleting source
✅ **Context Availability**: Context retrievable on-demand in any session
✅ **No Hook Failures**: No more auto-preserve errors
✅ **Smart Mapping**: PROJECT_MAP.md shows relevant files only
✅ **True Portability**: Can install from any location

## Progress Tracking

**Completed:**
- ✅ Identified root causes
- ✅ Designed solution architecture
- ✅ Enhanced
