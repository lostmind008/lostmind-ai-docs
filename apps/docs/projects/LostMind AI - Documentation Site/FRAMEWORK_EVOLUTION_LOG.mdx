# Claude Agentic Development Framework (CADF)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Under Review
**Date:** 2025-08-29

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Claude Agentic Development Framework (CADF), a structured environment designed to enhance the reliability, consistency, and capability of an AI agent for complex software development tasks.

The primary goal of this framework is to transform the AI from a simple code generator into a disciplined, context-aware development partner. It achieves this by establishing a clear set of rules (Protocols), roles (Personas), and a persistent memory (State).

This document is divided into three parts:
1.  An explanation of the initial `v1` architecture.
2.  A summary of research into the official Anthropic Claude CLI's functionality.
3.  A cross-analysis identifying discrepancies between the `v1` design and the official implementation, leading to a proposal for a `v2` framework.

## 2. Framework Architecture (`v1`)

The `v1` framework is designed around a two-tiered context system: a User-Level setup (`~/.claude/`) for global preferences and a Project-Level setup (`<project>/.claude/`) for project-specific rules.

### 2.1. Logical Components

The project-level framework is composed of four main logical components:

*   **Protocols (`protocols/`):** The "constitution" of the project. A set of non-negotiable Markdown files that define the project's mission, tech stack, workflow, and security rules. The AI is instructed to read and adhere to these at all times.
    *   **Logic:** This modular approach was chosen for clarity and separation of concerns, making it easier for both humans and the AI to manage different aspects of the project's rules.

*   **Personas (`personas/`):** Defines distinct roles or "modes" for the AI to adopt (e.g., Architect, Coder, Tester). By assuming a persona, the AI can focus its attention on a specific aspect of the development lifecycle, improving the quality of its output.
    *   **Logic:** This was designed to manage the AI's cognitive focus, preventing it from mixing high-level planning with low-level implementation details in the same response.

*   **State (`state/`):** The AI's memory. It includes a short-term `session_summary.md` and a long-term `project_map.md` that the AI is responsible for maintaining.
    *   **Logic:** This component was created to combat context window limitations and "agent amnesia," providing a persistent, structured memory of the project's architecture and session history.

*   **Workflow & Setup (`setup.sh`, `workflow.md`, `prompts/`):** A set of tools for the human user to initialize the framework in a new project and interact with the AI in a structured way.
    *   **Logic:** These files are the user-facing "interface" to the framework, designed to make it easy to deploy and use.

## 3. Research Findings: Official Claude CLI Functionality

A targeted investigation into the official Anthropic Claude CLI ("Claude Code") documentation and community best practices yielded the following key findings:

*   **Configuration Files:** The CLI officially recognizes `~/.claude/settings.json` (user) and `.claude/settings.json` (project) for configuration.
*   **Primary Context File:** A single file, `CLAUDE.md`, in the project root is the officially recognized primary source of project-specific context. The CLI is hardwired to look for this file.
*   **Custom Commands:** The CLI has a built-in system for custom commands. Users can add Markdown files to a `.claude/commands/` directory, and these become available as slash commands (e.g., `/mycommand`) within the interactive session.
*   **Hooks:** The CLI supports hooks that are triggered on lifecycle events (e.g., `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`). These are configured within `settings.json` and execute specified shell commands. This is the official mechanism for automation.
*   **Agent Personas:** The concept of "personas" or "agents" is not a built-in feature of the CLI. It is a "soft" pattern, meaning it's implemented by providing instructions in the `CLAUDE.md` file that tell the agent to read other files and act in a certain way.

## 4. Cross-Analysis: `v1` vs. Official Documentation

This section identifies the discrepancies and weaknesses of the `v1` framework when compared against the official Claude CLI implementation.

### 4.1. Discrepancy: Context Mechanism

*   **`v1` Approach:** A multi-file `protocols/` directory.
*   **Official Method:** A single, primary `CLAUDE.md` file.
*   **Analysis:** The `v1` approach is arguably cleaner but requires explicit instructions for the AI to find and read multiple files. The official method is more robust because the CLI is pre-programmed to automatically load and prioritize `CLAUDE.md`, guaranteeing the context is always available without special instructions. **This is a significant weakness in `v1`.**

### 4.2. Discrepancy: Custom Commands

*   **`v1` Approach:** A standalo
