# Command: /ucf-context-summary

## Your Role: Context Summary Specialist

This command provides an AI-generated summary of recent project decisions and key context from the Guardian's conversation synthesis.

## Your Workflow

1. **Load Guardian Context**: Read the project's Guardian-generated context files
   ```bash
   ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
   PROJECT_CONTEXT="./.claude/context"

   if [ ! -d "$PROJECT_CONTEXT" ]; then
       echo "❌ No Guardian context found. Run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Key Context Files**:
   ```bash
   echo "📊 Guardian Context Summary"
   echo "=========================="
   echo ""

   # Show project insights
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/context_insights.md" ]; then
       echo "🎯 **Key Insights:**"
       head -50 "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/context_insights.md"
       echo ""
   fi

   # Show recent decisions
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/decision_timeline.json" ]; then
       echo "📋 **Recent Decisions:**"
       python3 -c "
import json
import sys
try:
    with open('$PROJECT_CONTEXT/decision_timeline.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    if isinstance(data, list) and len(data) > 0:
        for i, decision in enumerate(data[-5:]):  # Last 5 decisions
            if isinstance(decision, dict):
                print(f'{i+1}. {decision.get(\"summary\", \"Decision\")}')
    else:
        print('No decisions found in timeline')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Could not parse decisions: {e}')
"
       echo ""
   fi

   # Show session statistics
   if [ -f "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/session_analysis.md" ]; then
       echo "📈 **Session Statistics:**"
       grep -E "(Total Sessions|Total Conversations)" "$PROJECT_CONTEXT/session_analysis.md" | head -10
       echo ""
   fi
   ```

3. **Provide Summary**: Present the consolidated context summary to help orient the user with current project state

## Benefits

- **Immediate Context**: Get project context without reading large files
- **Decision History**: See what decisions were made recently
- **Session Awareness**: Understand conversation patterns
- **No Injection**: Works in current session without hooks

## Usage Notes

- Requires Guardian context (run `/ucf-onboard-project` first)
- Provides summary of last 5 decisions and key insights
- Safe to run multiple times - just reads existing context
