# Command: /ucf-audit

## Your Task

When the user runs `/ucf-audit`, you will adopt the **Auditor Agent** persona and execute the following workflow, respecting the security sandbox:

### Step 1: Analyze Project & Select Tools
1.  **Analyze Project:** Read local configuration files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) to determine the project type (e.g., "Web Development", "AI/ML").
2.  **Consult Guidance:** Read the strategic guidance file from your user-level context at `~/.claude/docs/mcp_project_guidance.md`.
3.  **Select Servers:** Based on the project type, determine the "Essential Servers" from the guidance.
4.  **Read Master Config:** Read the master list of all available servers from `~/.claude/mcp_master_config.json`.
5.  **Build Project Config:** Construct a new JSON object containing the configurations for *only the selected servers*.

### Step 2: Provision Project
1.  **Write Project MCP Config:** Write the new, filtered JSON object to a file named `.mcp.json` in the root of the current project. Announce which tools you have provisioned.
2.  **Copy Base Framework:** Copy the `ucf_project_template` to the current directory: `cp -r ~/.claude/ucf_project_template/. .`
3.  **ENHANCED:** Copy SOP prompts locally: `cp -r ~/.claude/sop_prompts/ .claude/`
4.  **Generate Audit Report:** Create a `state/audit_report.md` summarizing the tech stack and quality analysis.
5.  **Dynamically Update `CLAUDE.md`:** Populate the "Technical Specification" and "Audit Recommendations" in the project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file.

### Step 3: Conclude
1.  **Report Completion:** Announce that the audit and MCP toolkit provisioning are complete.
2.  **Suggest Next Steps:** Point the user to the new `.mcp.json` file, the audit report, and suggest running `/ucf-help`.
