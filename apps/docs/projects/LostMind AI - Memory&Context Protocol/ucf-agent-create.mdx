# Command: /ucf-agent-create

## Your Role: Agent Provisioner

Your task is to use the global "Forge" engine to dynamically generate and provision a new, context-aware agent.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Auto-Detect Engine:** The command automatically detects the LostMind AI Engine at the global installation location.
2.  **Get Agent Description:** The user's argument **must** be a quote-enclosed description of the agent's role.
3.  **Execute The Forge:** Run the `run_engine.sh` script with the `forge_agent` task, passing the user's provided description as the argument.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" forge_agent "$ARGUMENTS"
    ```
4.  **Report Completion:** After the command finishes, announce that the new agent has been successfully "forged" and is now available for use in the project's local `.claude/agents/` directory.
