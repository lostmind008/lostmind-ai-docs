## External Community Agents

This directory contains a subset of community‑provided sub‑agents from popular repositories.

- **lst97/claude-code-sub-agents**: A collection of sub‑agents organised into categories (business, data‑AI, development, infrastructure, quality, security, specialisation).  These agents have been extracted into the `lst97/` folder.
- **wshobson/agents**: A collection of production‑ready sub‑agents covering frontend, backend, testing, DevOps and more.  This package includes example agents (`backend-architect.md`, `frontend-developer.md`, `test-automator.md`).  To install the full set of agents, run the commands below.

### Installing all wshobson agents

If you wish to import the entire set of agents from the `wshobson/agents` repository, execute the following from within this directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/agents.git .
# Or download the zip archive and extract it here.
```

After cloning, review the agent definitions and adjust tool permissions or descriptions as necessary to align with your security policies.  Remove or rename any agents that conflict with existing ones.

### Updating agents

To update community agents, fetch the latest changes from the respective repositories.  Keep an eye on versioning and ensure compatibility with your existing workflows.
