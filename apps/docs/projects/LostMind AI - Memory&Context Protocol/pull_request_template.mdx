# PR Title (Semantic + Imperative)
# e.g., ðŸ”§ FIX: Deterministic bridge + CLAUDE.md integration (Phase 1)

## Purpose
- What problem does this PR solve? Why now?

## Changes
- High-level summary of changes (bullets)
- Note any migrations or shims

## Test Plan
- Commands run (copy/paste outputs or attach logs):
  - `python test_bridge_installation/test_framework_bridge.py`
  - `python lostmind_ai_engine/guardian_wrapper.py status`
  - Hooks exercised (PreCompact/SessionEnd) and resulting files in `.lostmind_ai_context/`
  - CLAUDE.md updated once with markers and correct links
- Optional: `bash test_end_to_end.sh`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bridge resolves deterministically (env or per-project config)
- [ ] `/ucf-onboard-project` generates `.lostmind_ai_context/*` and updates project memory file (idempotent)
- [ ] `/ucf-guardian-status` reports configured engine and freshness
- [ ] Hooks export/synthesize automatically; artifacts timestamps update
- [ ] No duplication or movement of `framework_hub/core/*`

## Risks & Rollback
- Risks identified and mitigations
- Rollback steps (files to revert, settings backups)

## Config & Docs
- Env vars (e.g., `LOSTMIND_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- Docs updated (`AGENTS.md`, `DOCS/*`)

## Checklist
- [ ] Scope is minimal and changes are cohesive
- [ ] Added/updated docs
- [ ] Manually verified on macOS/Linux (if applicable)
- [ ] No secrets committed
