# Smart Commit Command

Analyze staged changes and create intelligent commits with conventional commit messages, proper scoping, and comprehensive descriptions.

## Process

1. **Analyze Staged Changes**:
   - Scan all staged files for changes
   - Identify change patterns (features, fixes, refactoring, docs)
   - Detect scope based on file locations and change types
   - Assess impact level and breaking changes

2. **Generate Conventional Commit**:
   - Apply conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
   - Use appropriate types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Include scope based on affected modules/areas
   - Add breaking change indicators when needed

3. **Create Comprehensive Message**:
   - Write clear, actionable commit subject (≤50 chars)
   - Add detailed body explaining what and why (≤72 chars per line)
   - Include co-authors if pair programming detected
   - Add issue references if branch name contains ticket numbers

## Commit Types

- **feat**: New features or functionality
- **fix**: Bug fixes and issue resolution  
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **style**: Code style, formatting, missing semi-colons
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, build changes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **revert**: Reverting previous commits

## Scope Detection

Automatically detect scope based on:
- Directory structure (frontend, backend, api, ui, auth, etc.)
- File types and patterns
- Package.json scripts and dependencies
- Git repository structure
- Previous commit patterns

## Example Output

```bash
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authentication flow

- Add OAuth2 provider integration with Google and GitHub
- Implement JWT token handling and refresh logic
- Add user session management with secure cookies
- Include comprehensive error handling for auth failures

Breaking change: Updates user model schema
Resolves: #123, #124
Co-authored-by: teammate@example.com
```

## Arguments

- `--no-verify`: Skip pre-commit hooks
- `--amend`: Amend the last commit instead of creating new one
- `message`: Override auto-generated message with custom text

## Integration

Works seamlessly with:
- Pre-commit hooks (Husky, lint-staged)
- Conventional changelog generation
- Semantic versioning automation
- Pull request templates
- Issue tracking systems

Execute commit analysis and generate intelligent conventional commit messages that maintain project history quality and enable automated changelog generation.
