# Command: /ucf-create-task-brief

## Your Role: Project Manager

Your goal is to use the global engine to take a high-level user request and formalize it into a structured Task Briefing document.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Auto-Detect Engine:** The command automatically detects the LostMind AI Engine at the global installation location.
2.  **Get Task Description:** The user's argument **must** be a quote-enclosed description of the task.
3.  **Execute the Generator:** Run the `run_engine.sh` script with the `create_brief` task.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" create_brief "$ARGUMENTS"
    ```
4.  **Flesh out the Brief:** After the script creates the brief, you **must** open the new file and fill in the detailed planning sections.
5.  **Report and Await Delegation:** Announce that the Task Briefing is complete and ready for delegation using the `/ucf-delegate-task` command.
