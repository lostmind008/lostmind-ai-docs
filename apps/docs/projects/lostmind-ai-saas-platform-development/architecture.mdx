# Architecture Overview

## System Overview

The LostMind AI SaaS Platform is a production-ready AI-powered platform built with Next.js 15, Turborepo, and FastAPI. The architecture focuses on scalable microservices, modern development practices, and seamless AI integration.

## Key Components

- **Frontend Applications**: Next.js 15 apps (Ask, Marketing) with React 19
- **Backend Services**: FastAPI microservices for AI computation
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM and Row Level Security
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini) with unified client
- **Authentication**: Auth.js v5 with Google OAuth
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration
- **Monorepo Management**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Library**: React 19 Stable
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Modern CSS-in-JS solutions

### Backend
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma with Row Level Security
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: Auth.js v5

### AI & Services
- **AI Provider**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- **Payment**: Stripe
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Google Cloud Run (Backend)
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and analytics

## Design Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
- **Tool**: Turborepo for efficient build and dependency management
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for workspace optimization
- **Organization**: Clear separation between apps, packages, and services

### Microservices Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and AI compute services are decoupled
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of frontend and backend services
- **Development**: Parallel development of different service components

### Security First
- **Authentication**: Robust OAuth implementation with Auth.js
- **Database**: Row Level Security in PostgreSQL
- **API**: Secure FastAPI endpoints with proper validation
- **Secrets**: Environment-based secret management
