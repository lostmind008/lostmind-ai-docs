# Architecture Overview

## System Overview
ContextKeeper anchors project memory behind a Sacred Layer that locks approved architectural plans while a RAG agent serves contextual answers to developers and AI assistants. The system is designed to keep day-to-day coding aligned with strategic intent.

## Core Services
- **Sacred Layer Service** — Immutable plan registry with dual-factor approval
- **RAG Agent** — Clusters repository knowledge in ChromaDB and answers natural-language queries
- **Git Activity Tracker** — Watches commits to detect drift from the Sacred Layer
- **CLI & MCP Tools** — Shell tooling and Claude Code MCP endpoints for interactive access

## Data Storage
- **ChromaDB** stores per-project embeddings plus the Sacred Layer corpus
- **Project State Files** persist objectives, decisions, and alignment metrics
- **Environment Variables** (SACRED_APPROVAL_KEY, API tokens) gate access to write paths

## Integration Points
- **Google Cloud GenAI** supplies embeddings and responses when cloud inference is permitted
- **Local Security Mode** falls back to on-device models for sensitive repositories
- **Claude Code MCP** exposes Sacred-aware tooling directly inside the IDE

## Security Model
- Immutable plan hashes plus the Sacred Approval Key prevent unreviewed changes
- Drift detection flags commits that contradict Sacred Layer directives
- All secrets stay local; network calls are limited to configured AI providers
