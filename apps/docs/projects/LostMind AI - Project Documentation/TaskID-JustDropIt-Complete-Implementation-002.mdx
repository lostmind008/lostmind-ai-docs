# TaskID: JustDropIt-Complete-Implementation-002

**Status**: üü¢ ACTIVE
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Duration**: 3 days
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-19

## üìã Executive Summary

Complete the JustDropIt MVP implementation by fixing critical architectural gaps identified in the code audit. The @lostmind/ai-clients package has "complete architecture with zero implementation" - all methods throw "not yet implemented" errors. The Ask app bypasses the AI abstraction layer entirely. Several JustDropIt components need completion with real Google GenAI integration.

## üéØ Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Implement working Google GenAI provider in @lostmind/ai-clients package
2. ‚úÖ Fix Ask app to use the AI clients abstraction layer
3. ‚úÖ Complete JustDropIt frontend components with full functionality
4. ‚úÖ Add real AI document analysis to the Python service
5. ‚úÖ Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure
6. ‚úÖ Complete billing and database integrations

## üìä Current State vs Required State

### Current Issues:
- ‚ùå @lostmind/ai-clients: All methods throw "not yet implemented"
- ‚ùå Ask app: Uses mock AI client, bypasses abstraction layer
- ‚ùå Document processor: Placeholder analysis logic
- ‚ùå Frontend components: Incomplete implementations
- ‚ùå Testing: ~5% coverage despite infrastructure
- ‚ùå Billing: Placeholder webhook handlers

### Target State:
- ‚úÖ Fully functional AI clients package with Google GenAI
- ‚úÖ Ask app using real AI through abstraction layer
- ‚úÖ Document processor with AI-powered analysis
- ‚úÖ Complete, production-ready frontend components
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- ‚úÖ Working billing integration with Stripe
