# Architecture Overview

## System Overview
The PropTech Variance Commentary Tool ingests property finance workbooks, normalises data into a relational model, and generates AI-authored variance narratives for month-end reporting.

## Core Modules
- **Data Ingestion & Sanitisation** — Converts Knight Frank-style XLSM exports into a privacy-safe dataset
- **SQL Modelling Layer** — Builds structured tables for ledgers, payables, and property metadata
- **Variance Engine** — Calculates period deltas and surfaces exceptions that need commentary
- **AI Commentary Service** — Prompts foundation models to draft auditor-friendly explanations
- **Publishing Pipeline** — Outputs summaries back into Excel, PDF, or downstream dashboards

## Integrations
- **Unified AI Client** connects to approved models (Gemma, Gemini, Claude) through the LostMind AI ai-compute service
- **TurboRepo Services** supply shared authentication, logging, and observability utilities
- **Security Scans** enforce data-governance policies before reports leave the environment

## Security Considerations
- Mandatory sanitisation step strips vendor names and sensitive PII before processing
- Configurable AI routing keeps regulated data on compliant infrastructure
- Audit logs capture every generated commentary block for finance review
