# PropTech Variance Commentary Tool

## Overview
LostMind AI's PropTech Variance Commentary Tool converts raw portfolio ledgers into CFO-ready variance narratives. It slots into the broader PropTech automation stack, sharing AI orchestration, security, and observability patterns with the SaaS platform.

## Key Capabilities
- **Workbook Sanitisation** — Redacts Knight Frank source files before any AI processing
- **Variance Detection** — Highlights period deltas across thousands of GL and AP records
- **AI Commentary** — Generates auditor-friendly explanations with configurable tone
- **Portfolio Views** — Groups insights by property, manager, or account class
- **Compliance Guardrails** — Ensures Australian data-sovereignty requirements are respected

## Quick Start
Use the upstream repository scripts as a guide when operating locally:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Sanitise source workbook (mandatory)
python sanitize_data.py

# 3. Build the SQL model
python excel_to_sql.py

# 4. Generate commentary draft
python scripts/run_variance_commentary.py --period 2024-12
```

AI features connect through the shared `ai_integration/unified_client.py` module. Configure provider access in `.env` and route sensitive data to on-prem Gemma if compliance demands it.

## Documentation Snapshot
Historical implementation notes, data dictionaries, and operating guides are stored in the `_archived/projects` tree for this initiative. Consult those files for detailed workflows while the live docs are pruned.

## Support
Raise issues through the LostMind AI platform team or reach out via the internal support channel when variance commentary output needs review.
