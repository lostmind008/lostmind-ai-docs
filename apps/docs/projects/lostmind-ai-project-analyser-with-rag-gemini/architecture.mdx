# Architecture Overview

## System Overview
Gemini Analyzer couples a Python FastAPI service with a Tkinter desktop client to deliver dual-mode project intelligence: cloud-powered analysis via Google Gemini 2.5 or fully local processing for sensitive codebases.

## Application Modes
- **Desktop GUI** — Tkinter interface that performs local scans and presents insights without leaving the workstation
- **REST API Service** — FastAPI deployment with Docker packaging for CI/CD and enterprise integrations
- **Shared Core Library** — Common analysis logic consumed by both the GUI and API layers

## Key Components
- **Analysis Engine**: Multi-language parsers, dependency mapping, and metrics collectors
- **AI Orchestrator**: Routes requests to Gemini 2.5 or privacy-first local models
- **Storage Layer**: Project metadata, cached insights, and optional SQL backend
- **Config & Validation**: Pydantic settings plus strict schema validation

## Integrations
- **Google Generative AI SDK** for hosted intelligence when API keys are provided
- **Docker** deployment for consistent production environments
- **CLI & Scripts** to bootstrap analysis tasks and health checks

## Security & Privacy
- Local-only mode ensures sensitive repositories never leave the machine
- Sanitised uploads for remote analysis with optional API key gating
- Audit-ready logging across both GUI and API deployments
