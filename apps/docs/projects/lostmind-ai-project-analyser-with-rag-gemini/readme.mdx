> **Enterprise-grade project analysis platform with dual-mode AI intelligence and privacy-first architecture**

An advanced project intelligence platform that combines comprehensive local analysis with cutting-edge AI capabilities. Built for developers, security teams, and DevOps professionals who need deep project understanding without compromising on privacy or performance.

## 🚀 Overview

Gemini Analyzer is a comprehensive project intelligence platform that revolutionizes how teams understand and analyze codebases. Originally conceived to solve the challenge of rapidly understanding complex projects across different programming languages and frameworks, it has evolved into a full-featured analysis platform.

### Key Features

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

This project is built with a modern, robust technology stack:

*   **Backend:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for high-performance, asynchronous API services.
*   **AI Integration:** [Google Generative AI SDK](https://ai.google.dev/docs/sdk) (`google-generativeai`), the official and current library for the Gemini family of models.
*   **Desktop GUI:** [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), Python's standard cross-platform GUI toolkit.
*   **Data Validation:** [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for robust data validation and settings management in the API.
*   **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for creating portable, production-ready containers for the backend service.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is designed for ease of use, both for local development and for deployment.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Docker (for running the backend service)
*   An optional `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable for cloud-based AI features.

### Local Development & Running the GUI

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gemini-magic.git
    cd gemini-magic
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Install base GUI dependencies + AI dependencies
    pip install -e ".[ai,dev]"
    ```

3.  **Run the GUI application:**
    ```bash
    python -m gemini_analyzer.gui.main
    ```

### Running the Backend Service with Docker

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t gemini-analyzer-service .
    ```

2.  **Run the container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key" gemini-analyzer-service
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive documentation can be found at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## 🤖 For AI Agents: How to Contribute

This repository is designed to be developed in parallel by multiple AI agents. Each core module contains a `README.md` and `TODO` comments to guide you.

*   **If you are the GUI Agent:** Your primary focus is the `src/gemini_analyzer/gui/` directory. Start by reading its `README.md` to understand the component structure. Your goal is to build a responsive and intuitive user interface using the components and logic available.
*   **If you are the Core Logic Agent:** Your domain is `src/gemini_analyzer/core/`. Read its `README.md`. You will implement the heavy lifting of project analysis, ensuring the code is efficient, accurate, and can be used by both the GUI and the API.
*   **If you are the API Agent:** You will work within `src/gemini_analyzer/api/`. Your task is to create robust FastAPI endpoints that expose the functionality from the `core` modules, including proper data validation and error handling.
