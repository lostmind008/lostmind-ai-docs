## 🎯 Vision
Enterprise-grade PropTech financial automation platform that transforms complex Excel-based property accounting processes into an intelligent, scalable, AI-powered microservices architecture serving the Australian commercial real estate industry.

---
## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure AI Integration
```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Set AI_COMPUTE_URL to your TurboRepo ai-compute service
# Default: http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Sanitise Your Data (IMPORTANT - Do this first!)
```bash
python sanitize_data.py
```
This creates a privacy-safe version of your Knight Frank Excel tool.

### 4. Create Database Schema
```bash
python excel_to_sql.py
```
This analyses the Excel structure and creates an SQL database.

### 5. Test AI Integration
```bash
python scripts/test_integration.py
```
Validates the modernized AI architecture is working correctly.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING**

**⚠️ CONTAINS REAL KNIGHT FRANK DATA - HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE ⚠️**

### 🔐 **MANDATORY First Step - Data Sanitization**

The Excel file `SM_Accrual_Review_TEMPLATE.xlsm` contains **real, sensitive Knight Frank financial data**:
- ✅ 16,598 actual General Ledger transactions
- ✅ 2,084 real Accounts Payable records
- ✅ Actual vendor names and contact information
- ✅ Real property names and addresses
- ✅ Genuine financial amounts and calculations

### 🚨 **BEFORE ANY DEVELOPMENT OR SHARING:**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS RUN THIS FIRST
python sanitize_data.py

# STEP 2: VERIFY no sensitive data remains
# Review the generated SM_Accrual_Review_SANITISED.xlsm file

# STEP 3: Only then proceed with development
python excel_to_sql.py
```

### 🔒 **Data Privacy Rules:**
1. **NEVER** commit the original `SM_Accrual_Review_TEMPLATE.xlsm` to any public repository
2. **NEVER** share unsanitised data outside your secure environment
3. **ALWAYS** use `Gemma` (local model) for Australian data compliance
4. **ALWAYS** run sanitization before any external collaboration

### ✅ **After Sanitization, Data Becomes:**
- Vendor names → `VENDOR_0001_PTY_LTD`
- Property names → `NSW_OFF_001_Sydney_CBD`
- Amounts → Randomised ±10% (maintaining statistical distribution)
- Employee data → Completely removed
- Structure & formulas → Fully preserved

## 🔐 Data Privacy & Security

### Sanitisation Process
The `sanitize_data.py` script ensures your Knight Frank data is safe to use:
- Vendor names → Generic codes (VENDOR_0001)
- Property names → NSW property codes (NSW_OFF_001_Sydney CBD)
- Employee data → Removed
- Amounts → Randomised ±10%
- Formulas & structure → Preserved

### Compliance Considerations
- **Gemma Model**: Local processing for Australian data requirements
- **Data Isolation**: Separate development and production environments
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all changes

## 🎯 Use Cases

### AI-Enhanced Monthly Accruals ✅
```python
# NOW AVAILABLE - AI-powered accrual processing
from microservices.accrual_calculator.main import AccrualCalculator

calculator = AccrualCalculator()

# Traditional calculation with AI validation
accruals = calculator.calculate_expense_accruals("2024-12", "NSW_OFF_001")

# AI-powered variance explanation
variance_data = {/* "account": "4000", "variance": 5000, "percentage": 15.5 */}
explanation = calculator.explain_variance(variance_data, "2024-12")
print(explanation)  # AI generates detailed explanation
```

### Modern AI Integration ✅
```python
# NOW AVAILABLE - Direct AI service integration
from ai_integration.unified_client import UnifiedAIClient

async def analyze_financial_data():
    async with UnifiedAIClient() as client:
        # Australian-compliant financial analysis
        result = await client.analyze_financial_data(
            data={"transactions": transaction_data},
            analysis_type="variance"
        )

        # Accrual validation with confidence scoring
        validation = await client.validate_accruals(
            accrual_data=accruals_list,
            period="2024-12"
        )

        return result, validation
```

### Property Portfolio Analysis
```python
# Coming soon - enhanced with AI insights
from microservices.variance_analyzer import VarianceAnalyzer

analyzer = VarianceAnalyzer()
variances = analyzer.compare_periods("2024-11", "2024-12")
ai_insights = analyzer.generate_ai_insights(variances)  # AI-powered analysis
```
