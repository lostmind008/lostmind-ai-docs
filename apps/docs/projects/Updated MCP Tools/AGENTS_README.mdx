# Claude Code Subagents Collection

A comprehensive collection of 33 specialized AI subagents for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), designed to enhance development workflows with domain-specific expertise and intelligent automation.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains a curated set of specialized subagents that extend Claude Code's capabilities across the entire software development lifecycle. Each subagent is an expert in a specific domain, automatically invoked based on context analysis or explicitly called when specialized expertise is needed.

### Key Features

- **ü§ñ Intelligent Auto-Delegation**: Claude Code automatically selects optimal agents based on task context
- **üîß Domain Expertise**: Each agent specializes in specific technologies, patterns, and best practices
- **üîÑ Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Seamless coordination between agents for complex workflows
- **üìä Quality Assurance**: Built-in review and validation patterns across all domains
- **‚ö° Performance Optimized**: Agents designed for efficient task completion and resource utilization

## Available Subagents
