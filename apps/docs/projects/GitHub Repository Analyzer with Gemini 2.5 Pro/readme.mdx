# The Forge: Dynamic Agent Provisioning System (v3)

## 1. Overview

The Forge is a sophisticated agent provisioning system for the LostMind AI Framework. It is the engine that creates the skilled, autonomous "employees" for our "Office Team" development model.

Its mission is to create specialist agents that are not generic tools, but professional personas tailored for high-quality, autonomous work. It achieves this by combining detailed, role-specific templates with a powerful, Gemini-driven process that generates rich, contextual instructions for Claude, the master orchestrator.

## 2. The Core Workflow

The Forge is triggered by the `/ucf-agent-create` command. Here is the step-by-step workflow:

1.  **User Invocation:** The user runs the command with a professional description of the desired agent's role (e.g., `/ucf-agent-create "A QA reviewer specializing in Python backend logic."`).
2.  **Template Selection:** The core script, `forge_agent.py`, intelligently selects the appropriate professional blueprint from the `agent_templates/` directory (e.g., `qa_reviewer_template.md`).
3.  **Gemini-Powered Description Generation:** This is the most critical step. The script calls the Gemini 1.5 Pro API to generate a sophisticated, single-line, few-shot `description` for the new agent. This description includes `<example>` and `<commentary>` tags, which provide the orchestrator (the main Claude session) with concrete examples of when to use, and when *not* to use, this new specialist. This dramatically improves the orchestrator's decision-making accuracy.
4.  **Agent Forging:** The script populates the chosen template with the agent's new name and the rich, Gemini-generated description.
5.  **Agent Provisioning:** The script saves the final, professional agent file (e.g., `qa-reviewer-python-backend.md`) directly into the **project's local `.claude/agents/` directory**, making it immediately available for delegation.

The result is a new "team member," ready to be assigned tasks via a "Task Briefing," that is a world-class expert in its designated role.

## 3. Components

*   **`/ucf-agent-create` command:** The user-facing trigger.
*   **`forge_agent.py` script:** The Python engine that orchestrates the agent generation, including the call to the Gemini API.
*   **`agent_templates/` directory:** Contains the sophisticated, professional blueprints for different agent archetypes (architect, python_engineer, qa_reviewer, etc.), based on the best practices observed from Claude's own agent generation.

## 4. How It Implements the "Office Team" Model

*   **Hiring Specialists:** The Forge acts as the "hiring department," creating skilled professionals for specific roles rather than generalists.
*   **Training the Manager:** The Gemini-generated descriptions are the key to "training" the Project Manager (the main Claude instance) on how to best utilize its team, leading to better delegation and more successful outcomes.
*   **Enabling Autonomy:** By creating agents with clear, professional personas and responsibilities, The Forge enables them to execute their assigned "Task Briefings" with a high degree of autonomy and reliability.
