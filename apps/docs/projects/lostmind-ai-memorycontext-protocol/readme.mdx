# The LostMind AI Engine: A Protocol-Driven Framework for Claude Code

**Version:** 3.0 (Portable Engine Release)
**Author:** LostMind AI (Conceptualized by Sumit Mondal, Engineered by Gemini)

---

## 1. Philosophy: The "Why"

This framework is a comprehensive enhancement for the standard Universal Claude Framework (UCF). It was born from the real-world experience of a solo founder building a complex AI company through relentless, self-taught agentic development.

It solves the most critical challenges faced in long-running agentic projects:
-   **Context Loss:** Prevents agents from forgetting the plan.
-   **Agent Drift:** Stops agents from working on the wrong thing.
-   **Lack of Discipline:** Enforces a professional, structured, and repeatable workflow.
-   **Project Chaos:** Replaces a messy collection of files with a clean, organized, and self-documenting system.

This is not just a set of tools; it is a **protocol-driven methodology** for professional, agentic software development. It is designed to be a **global system enhancement** that integrates seamlessly with Claude Code to provide disciplined, reliable AI capabilities to all your projects.

## 2. The Architecture: Global System Enhancement

The framework is now installed as a global Claude Code system enhancement at `~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/`.

-   **The Engine (`~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/`):** This is the heart of the framework. It contains all the Python scripts, agent templates, and the master `run_engine.sh` script. Installed once as a system-level component, it provides LostMind AI capabilities to all your projects.
-   **The Context (`.lostmind_ai_context/`):** When you onboard a project, the engine creates this local directory. It contains the project-specific context files (`PROJECT_MAP.md`, `chat_history.md`), keeping the project's "brain" separate from the engine's "gears."

## 3. Step-by-Step Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install the Base UCF (One-Time Global Setup)

This framework requires the base Universal Claude Framework. If you haven't already, run the foundational installer script once:

```bash
bash /path/to/your/install_ucf_complete_safe.sh
```

### Step 2: Install the LostMind AI Framework (One-Time Global Setup)

Install the framework as a global Claude Code system enhancement.

1.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    ```bash
    ./install_lostmind_ai_framework.sh
    ```
    This installs the engine to `~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/` and sets up all UCF commands.

2.  **Configure Your API Key:**
    -   Navigate to the installed engine: `cd ~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine/`
    -   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
    -   Open `.env` and add your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

3.  **Clean Up (Optional):**
    ```bash
    cd .. && rm -rf /path/to/repository
    ```
    You can safely delete the repository after installation since the framework is now globally available.

## 4. The Protocol-Driven Workflow: A Practical Guide

This is the core workflow for using the framework on any project.

### Phase 1: Onboard the Project (One Command to Start)

For any new or existing project, run this single command to prepare it for the LostMind AI protocol.

1.  **Run the Onboarding Command:**
    ```
    /ucf-onboard-project
    ```
2.  **What it Does:** This command automatically detects the globally installed engine and runs the `onboarder.py` script. It automatically scans your project, creates the `PROJECT_MAP.md`, and pulls in the relevant chat history, saving them to a new `.lostmind_ai_context/` directory in your project.

Your project is now fully prepared for disciplined, agentic development.

### Phase 2: The "Office Team" Workflow

This is the day-to-day development cycle.

1.  **Create a Task Briefing:** The "Project Manager" (main Claude) plans a task.
    ```
    /ucf-create-task-brief "Create a new user authentication endpoint"
    ```
    Claude will then open the newly created brief file for you to fill in the details.

2.  **Scaffold the Plan (If Needed):** The "Architect" agent creates the skeleton files.
    ```
    /ucf-scaffold file python "src/auth.py" --purpose "Handles authentication logic"
    ```

3.  **Hire a Specialist (If Needed):** "The Forge" creates a new agent.
    ```
    /ucf-agent-create "A Python engineer specializing in FastAPI security"
    ```

4.  **Delegate the Task:** The "Project Manager" assigns the brief to the specialist.
    ```
    /ucf-delegate-task ".claude/task_briefs/brief_...md" "python-engineer-fastapi-security"
    ```

5.  **Review the Work:** The `qa-code-reviewer` provides the final quality gate.
