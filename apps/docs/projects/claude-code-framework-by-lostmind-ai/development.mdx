# CLAUDE.md — User Directory (Sumit Mondal)

Owner: Sumit Mondal
Profile: https://www.lostmindai.com
Primary AI Assistant: Comet / "LostMind AI Orb" (ask.lostmindai.com)

## PURPOSE
This file defines universal development, API verification, and context-preservation standards for all projects and subdirectories beneath this User profile. It ensures that all project work, from planning to implementation, follows best practice for trackable, validated, and future-proof AI/cloud/software development.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
- Plan Once, Scaffold Immediately, Verify Always
- API training data is NOT to be trusted — always search and validate.
- No implementation without verified, dated documentation.
- Sustain project context using breadcrumbs, explicit timestamps, and persistent memory.
- Use Australian English consistently in all documentation and code.

## DIRECTORIES & INHERITANCE
All directories underneath the User directory MUST follow these standards:
- Each directory includes its own CLAUDE.md extending from this root.
- CLAUDE.md at directory/project level MUST record:
  - Purpose, parent/child context, API dependencies (with dated verification status)
  - All planning decisions (with timing and API impact)
  - File purposes and API usage
  - Verification schedules, compliance, and next required checks
  - ALL code and doc comments in Australian English

## UNIVERSAL API VERIFICATION STANDARD
NO advice, integration, or synthesis involving AI/ML/cloud APIs, SDKs, or frameworks may be actioned without a live, dated, multi-source verification.

When to trigger a search:
- Any: model/SDK/service/framework name, API endpoint, package install, breaking/preview/deprecation note, authentication method, pricing/limits, version, feature list, migration, region info.

How to verify:
1) Search: "[Service] API documentation latest [Month Year]"
2) Search: "[Service] breaking changes [Year]"
3) Cross-check official docs, GitHub, developer portals, and release logs from the last 6 months.
4) Return only practices with a stated verification date and source citation: “as of [date] …”
5) Log status into each file or directory with an API VERIFICATION block.

If verification fails:
1) State clearly: “Cannot verify current API status without search”
2) Add disclaimer: “This may be outdated — please verify at [official source]”
3) Request manual confirmation if critical
4) Never fill gaps based on unverified knowledge

Example verification block (paste into code/docs):

API VERIFICATION BLOCK
Service: [Service Name]
Documentation: [URL]
Last Verified: [Date]
Current Version: [version]
Status: [Stable/Preview/Deprecated/etc.]
Breaking Changes: [Yes/No – Details]
Next Verification: [Date + 30 days]
text

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT & CONTEXT
- PROJECT_MAP.md required in each project root:
  - Project summary, directory structure, API dependencies, planning history, active decisions, verification schedules
- Every planning session MUST:
  - Run ls -la; create/refresh directory tree with file purposes
  - Check for README, PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, and CLAUDE.md presence
  - Audit all API dependencies and log current status
  - Update PROJECT_MAP.md and relevant directory/file comment blocks

Tip: When running multiple features in parallel, use Git worktrees and separate Claude instances to isolate context and avoid cross-contamination (e.g., worktree per feature branch with its own CLAUDE session and hooks), and keep PROJECT_MAP.md updated per branch to reflect active decisions and verification status.

## FILE & DIRECTORY REQUIREMENTS
- Each code/doc file must declare purpose, context, dependencies, and verification status in the header.
- Each directory must have a contextualised CLAUDE.md.
- Skeleton files are created immediately after planning with context/todo/verification blocks.
- All files:
  - Know full path, purpose, creation/planning date, dependencies, dependents
  - Include navigation comments (Prev/Next/Parent)
- Track “TODO from planning” and “API verification pending” via comments and search
- Test plans must describe API mocking strategy (see TEST_PLAN.md)

## ENVIRONMENT & RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
- Update environment variables (e.g., ~/.zshrc) on project switch:
  - Use correct API keys, project IDs, service account file for current development context
  - Current: coral-muse project (as of 05.09.2025)
- Before deployments/data-cost tasks: confirm GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS match the intended project; do not proceed if mismatched.
- Log all changes in project-level or global CHANGELOG.md, noting resource switchovers and API key updates

## QUALITY CHECKLIST
Before any release, ensure:
- All planned files/directories are created with up-to-date skeletons
- All APIs/SDKs used have been verified in the last 30 days (see verification block)
- All directories have up-to-date CLAUDE.md with API status
- PROJECT_MAP.md and CHANGELOG.md are current and log all changes
- Navigation and context links (Prev/Next/Parent) exist for major files/modules
- All TODOs reference planning and verification sessions with dates
- Breaking changes are documented, and mitigation strategies set
- Next verification is scheduled (calendar reminders)

## COMMUNICATION & STYLE
- Write all doc and code comments in clear, matter-of-fact language, using Australian English
- State verification status with every API claim (“as of [date] …”)
- Explain “why” for major design/architecture choices
- Flag unverified information, deprecated features, or experimental/beta functions

Code signature example:

alright, using google-genai v1.0.12 as of 2025-09-13 (stable per docs; google-generativeai deprecates Nov 2025)
text

## SCHEDULE & REMINDERS
- Set monthly reminders for API verification/audit across active project resources
- Monitor releases, deprecation notices, and breaking changes
- For parallel development, keep a simple register of active worktrees and their verification due dates

## VERSION CONTROL & LIFECYCLE
- Track API version and breaking change history in CHANGELOG.md (impact and mitigation)
- Note expiry dates for preview/experimental features and monitor them
- Use feature flags and compatibility matrices for cross-version support

## EXTERNAL REFERENCES
- AI_API_GUIDELINES.md (must be checked for every AI/cloud API development)
- LostMind AI project and chat: www.lostmindai.com, ask.lostmindai.com
- Share this file with collaborators to ensure consistent onboarding and standards

## PERSONALISATION & GROWTH AREAS
Sumit’s interests:
- Verified AI/ML application development (Gemini, GPT, Claude)
- Cloud-native & full-stack applications
- Mobile SDKs
- Enterprise patterns and microservices
- MCP integrations

### REMINDER
Before giving any technical advice on APIs, SDKs, frameworks, or rapidly evolving tech: SEARCH, VERIFY, ANNOTATE, THEN IMPLEMENT.

If a project needs a local variation, add a short “Deviations from global” section at the top of the project’s CLAUDE.md and record the justification and timeframe, then inherit the rest verbatim to avoid drift.
