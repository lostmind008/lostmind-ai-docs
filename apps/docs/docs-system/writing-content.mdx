# Writing Content

This site uses MDX with a minimal component set. Structure pages with Overview → Navigation → Details.

## Page Anatomy

- Overview: one-paragraph summary
- Navigation: links to sibling pages
- Details: sections for tech, workflows, and references

## MDX Shortcuts

- Use CardGroup and Card for navigation
- Use Info/Tip/Warning for callouts
