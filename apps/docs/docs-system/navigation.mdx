# Navigation

Keep navigation shallow and predictable.

## Groups

- Get Started: intro and onboarding
- Docs System: how docs work
- Project Groups: Core Platforms, PropTech, AI Tools
- API Documentation: reference material
- Contributing: how to add content

## Updating Navigation

Edit `apps/docs/mint.json` and add page paths under the correct group. Avoid deep nesting.
