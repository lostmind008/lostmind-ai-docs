# Please provide an exhaustive technical breakdown of the current Anthropic Claude Code CLI (as of the latest public release post-August 2025), addressing all relevant agentic, command-line, and ecosystem integration functionalities. Draw from official Anthropic documentation, GitHub repositories, release changelogs, source code analysis, community forums (e.g., Reddit, GitHub issues), and any recent announcements or updates. Where possible, include code snippets, diagrams (described in text if visual rendering is unavailable), and verifiable references with URLs or commit hashes. Prioritize accuracy, depth, and recencyâ€”cross-verify information across multiple sources to resolve discrepancies, and note any deprecated features or breaking changes since August 2025.

Enhanced Coverage Checklist
For each topic below, supply precise implementation details backed by reference documentation, changelogs, source code, or empirical testing outputs (e.g., via code execution or CLI simulations). Include step-by-step explanations, edge cases, performance considerations, and best practices. If a feature has evolved recently, highlight pre- and post-August 2025 differences.

1. **Installation and Setup**
    - Detail supported platforms (e.g., macOS, Linux, Windows) and prerequisites (e.g., Python version, API keys).
    - Explain installation methods: pip, Homebrew, direct from GitHub, or containerized (e.g., Docker).
    - Cover initial configuration, including API key setup via environment variables or CLI flags, and any OAuth flows for integrations.
    - Note cross-platform compatibility issues, workarounds, and testing methodologies.
2. **Configuration Loading and Management**
    - Specify the full configuration file loading order and precedence:
        - Global: ~/.claude/settings.json
        - Project: <project>/.claude/settings.json
        - Local overrides: <project>/.claude/settings.local.json
        - Any additional layers (e.g., user-specific or temporary configs).
    - Explain handling of multiple config files (e.g., with --mcp-config or similar flags), conflict resolution strategies (e.g., deep merging, override priorities), and interactions with environment variables (e.g., CLAUDE_API_KEY overriding file values).
    - List all agent-specific configuration options, such as model selections, rate limits, or logging levels.
    - Discuss versioning of configs, migration tools for updates, and security best practices (e.g., avoiding sensitive data in versioned files).
3. **Agent and Subagent Functionality**
    - Detail the agent management and invocation system:
        - Registration: How agents/subagents are defined (e.g., via YAML/JSON configs or programmatic registration in code).
        - Activation: Mechanisms like @-mentions, explicit commands, or automatic triggering based on task context.
        - Task assignment: Routing logic, load balancing, and failover between agents.
    - Specify supported models for agents/subagents (e.g., Opus 4 for complex planning/reasoning, Haiku 3.5 for lightweight tasks, or custom fine-tunes). Include model switching dynamics and cost implications.
    - Explain the Task tool (dispatch_agent) in depth: Workflow coordination, parameter passing, asynchronous vs. synchronous execution, error handling, and integration with other tools.
    - Cover advanced agentic features: Hierarchical subagents, multi-agent collaboration (e.g., debate or consensus modes), and state persistence across sessions.
4. **Hook Execution Mechanism**
    - Outline all available lifecycle events for hooks, including but not limited to:
        - SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, PostCompact, ErrorOccurred, etc.
        - Any new events introduced since August 2025 (e.g., for AI safety or monitoring).
    - Describe the execution trigger system: Synchronous/asynchronous hooks, priority ordering, and conditional triggering (e.g., based on regex matches or event filters).
    - Detail the exact payload data and environment variables each hook receives (e.g., JSON payloads with event_type, context, tool_output; env vars like HOOK_EVENT_ID). Include examples of hook scripts in Python or shell.
    - Discuss extensibility: Custom hook registration, plugin systems, and performance overhead in long-running sessions.
5. **Custom Command Parsing and Execution**
    - Explain processing of user-invoked custom commands (e.g., /mycommand):
        - Directory structure: Parsing of .md, .py, or other files in commands/ or subdirectories.
        - Injection mechanics: Whether Markdown is injected raw, parsed structurally (e.g., via frontmatter for metadata), or executed as code.
        - Parameter handling: Argument parsing, validation, and defaults.
    - Cover best practices: Structuring command files for reusability
