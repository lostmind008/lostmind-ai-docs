# Updated MCP Tools

This project has been set up with Claude Code's Agent Dispatch Protocol for advanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools development and testing.

## Setup Complete âœ…

The project now includes:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Production engineering guidelines and Agent Dispatch Protocol
- **Agent System** - Strategic agent-organizer for complex multi-domain tasks
- **MCP Configuration** - Ready for MCP server integration

## Quick Start

For complex tasks involving multiple domains, simply describe what you need and Claude Code will automatically use the Agent Dispatch Protocol to:

1. Analyze your project requirements
2. Select the optimal team of specialized agents
3. Coordinate their work for best results

## Agent System

The project uses the **agent-organizer** system for:
- Multi-domain development tasks
- Complex architectural decisions
- Cross-functional requirements
- System-wide changes

## MCP Tools Available

When configured, this setup supports:
- **sequential-thinking** - Multi-step problem solving
- **context7** - Current documentation access
- **playwright** - Browser automation and testing
- **filesystem** - Enhanced file operations
- **magic** - Advanced UI component generation

## Usage

Just describe your development needs in natural language. The system will handle the complexity behind the scenes.

Example: "Build a user authentication system with security audit and API documentation"

The agent-organizer will analyze this request and coordinate the appropriate specialists automatically.
