# **TASK ID:** JUSTDROPIT-MVP-001

## **BRANCH:** `feature/intelligence-hub-mvp`

## **ESTIMATED TIME:** 6-8 hours

## **COMPLEXITY:** High

---

## **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ BEFORE EVERY ACTION**

### **CONTEXT WINDOW MANAGEMENT**

*   **AFTER EVERY 3 ACTIONS:** Re-read this complete task description.
*   **BEFORE EACH PHASE:** Re-read the task objectives and the specific phase requirements.
*   **IF CONTEXT COMPRESSED:** Re-read this task file, the project's root `CLAUDE.md`, and the `ARCHITECTURE.md` from the `LostmindAI-PropTech-Backend-v1-master` context.
*   **WHEN UNCERTAIN:** Stop, re-read the task, and validate your current action against the objectives.

### **WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS**

1.  **Create Branch:** Start by creating a new branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/intelligence-hub-mvp`.
2.  **Incremental Commits:** Make small, focused commits after completing each major step within a phase. Use Conventional Commit messages (e.g., `feat(db): create initial schema for intelligence hub`).
3.  **Final Deliverable:** After completing all phases, create a single, comprehensive Pull Request from `feature/intelligence-hub-mvp` to `main`. A detailed template for the PR description is provided in Phase 4.

## **TASK OBJECTIVE**

To build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the **LostMind AI Intelligence Hub** (codenamed `justdropit`). This involves creating a new, production-ready Next.js application within the existing Turborepo structure that allows users to upload documents and run sophisticated analyses powered by a new, integrated Python microservice.

## **CONTEXT TO PROVIDE TO CLAUDE**

*You will need to provide me with the full contents of the following projects and files so I have the necessary context to build this application correctly:*

1.  **The Entire `LostmindAI-PropTech-Backend-v1-master` Project:** This is the most critical context. I need all the Python scripts (`sanitize_data.py`, `excel_to_sql.py`, `microservices/accrual_calculator/main.py`, etc.) and the architecture documents (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATA_PRIVACY.md`). This contains the business logic for the analysis engine.
2.  **The Entire `LostMind-AI---Markdown-to-PDF-Converter--main` Project:** This will serve as the UI/UX inspiration for the new `justdropit` application's file upload and management interface. I will adapt its components and user flow.
3.  **The `CLAUDE.md` file from the root of the Turborepo:** This contains global rules and conventions I must follow.

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

*   [ ] A new Next.js application (`apps/justdropit`) is created and runs within the Turborepo.
*   [ ] A new FastAPI microservice (`services/document-processor`) is created, containerized, and integrates the logic from the `PropTech-Backend` project.
*   [ ] The database schema (`packages/db`) is updated to support users, documents, analysis jobs, and subscriptions.
*   [ ] The authentication package (`packages/auth`) is configured to work with the new database schema.
*   [ ] The `justdropit` app allows users to upload files, which are stored securely (e.g., GCS path in DB).
*   [ ] Users can trigger an analysis, which calls the `document-processor` service.
*   [ ] The app can poll for and display the results of the analysis.
*   [ ] A basic billing foundation is in place with a Stripe webhook to manage subscriptions.
*   [ ] A comprehensive Pull Request is created for review.

## **SCOPE BOUNDARIES**

### **INCLUDED IN SCOPE:**

*   Creating the new `apps/justdropit` and `services/document-processor`.
*   Updating `packages/db` and `packages/auth`.
*   Refactoring Python code from the `PropTech-Backend` project into the new FastAPI service.
*   Building the frontend workflow: Upload -> Analyze -> View Results.

### **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED:**

*   Modifying the `apps/ask` or `apps/marketing` applications.
*   Implementing every single analysis from the Python scripts. We will start with one (e.g., Accrual Analysis) as the proof-of-concept.
*   Building a full-featured payment UI. A simple webhook is sufficient for the MVP.
*   Deploying to production (this will be a separate task).

## **EXECUTION PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: Foundational Setup (Database & Authentication)**

**Objective:** Establish the data and user management backbone for the application.

1.  **Update Database Schema:**
    *   **Action:** Modify the file `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   **Details:** Add the `User`, `Document`, `AnalysisJob`, and `Subscription` models as defined in the architectural plan. Ensure relations are correctly defined.
    *   **Validation:** Run `pnpm db:push` to apply the changes to your local development database.
    *   **Commit:** `feat(db): add schema for intelligence hub documents and jobs`

2.  **Configure Authentication:**
    *   **Action:** Update `packages/auth/src/index.ts`.
    *   **Details:** Ensure the `PrismaAdapter` is correctly configured and that the `session` callback populates the
