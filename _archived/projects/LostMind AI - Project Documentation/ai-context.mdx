## **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ BEFORE EVERY ACTION**

### **CONTEXT WINDOW MANAGEMENT**

- **AFTER EVERY 3 ACTIONS:** Re-read this complete task description
- **BEFORE EACH PHASE:** Re-read the task objectives and current progress
- **IF CONTEXT COMPRESSED:** Re-read task + progress files + current phase requirements
- **WHEN UNCERTAIN:** Stop, re-read task, validate current action against objectives

### **PROGRESS TRACKING REQUIREMENTS**

- **IMMEDIATE FILE WRITING:** Write findings to files after each action
- **PROGRESS COMMITS:** Git commit after each completed phase
- **STATUS UPDATES:** Update progress tracking file continuously
- **VALIDATION CHECKS:** Verify completion before moving to next phase

### **TASK ADHERENCE PROTOCOL**

- [ ] Clear distinction between static code analysis and runtime verification
- [ ] Misleading security and functionality claims corrected
- [ ] Professional disclaimer about analysis limitations added
- [ ] All changes committed in clean, reviewable PR
- [ ] No code functionality changed, only documentation accuracy

## **SCOPE BOUNDARIES**

### **INCLUDED IN SCOPE:**

- Updating CLAUDE.md files with accurate assessments
- Adding disclaimers about static analysis limitations
- Correcting unverified functionality claims
- Distinguishing between code presence and working features
- Adding runtime verification requirements sections
- Professional documentation standards compliance

### **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED:**

- Any code modifications or improvements
- Adding new features or functionality
- Performance optimizations
- Architectural changes
- New file creation (except progress tracking)
- Stylistic improvements beyond accuracy

## **QUALITY STANDARDS**

## **EXECUTION PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: Setup and Discovery (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Initialize task tracking and identify all CLAUDE.md files requiring updates
**Deliverable:** `docs/progress/claude-memory-fix-progress.md`
**Validation Criteria:** All CLAUDE.md files identified and cataloged

#### **Pre-Phase Checklist:**

- [ ] Re-read full task description above
- [ ] Verify current git status and branch
- [ ] Confirm phase objectives understood
- [ ] Check available context window

#### **Phase Actions:**

1. **Create Task Tracking System**

```bash
# Create branch and progress tracking
git checkout -b docs/claude-memory-accuracy-fix
mkdir -p docs/progress
cd docs/progress

# Create master progress file
cat > claude-memory-fix-progress.md << 'EOF'
# CLAUDE.md Memory Fix Progress

## Task Objective
Fix critical accuracy issues in CLAUDE.md files by replacing unverified claims with evidence-based documentation.

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Setup and Discovery
- [ ] Phase 2: Main CLAUDE.md Analysis and Fix
- [ ] Phase 3: Package-Level CLAUDE.md Fixes
- [ ] Phase 4: Application-Level CLAUDE.md Fixes
- [ ] Phase 5: Final Validation and PR Creation

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Setup and Discovery
**Started:** [timestamp]
**Status:** In Progress

## Files to Update:
[To be populated]

## Completed Actions:
- [x] Created progress tracking system
EOF

git add claude-memory-fix-progress.md
git commit -m "docs: initialize CLAUDE.md memory fix tracking"
```

- **Output:** Progress tracking system created
- **File:** `docs/progress/claude-memory-fix-progress.md`
- **Validation:** File exists and is committed to git

2. **Discover All CLAUDE.md Files**

```bash
# Find all CLAUDE.md files in repository
echo "## CLAUDE.md Files Discovery" >> claude-memory-fix-progress.md
echo "**Discovery Date:** $(date)" >> claude-memory-fix-progress.md
echo "" >> claude-memory-fix-progress.md

# List all CLAUDE.md files
echo "### Files Found:" >> claude-memory-fix-progress.md
find ../../.. -name "CLAUDE.md" -type f | sort >> claude-memory-fix-progress.md

# Count total files
echo ""
