# ChatCrawler Architecture (Current)

This document describes the current, implemented architecture. For the consolidated current-and-future blueprint and monorepo plan, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_MONOREPO_PLAN.md`.

## Overview

Status: development prototype. The running stack today is:

- Frontend: Vite + React app in `client/` and a Next.js app in `apps/chatcrawler/`.
- API: Express 4 + TypeScript in `server/` serving REST endpoints and, in development, the Vite client.
- Worker: FastAPI (Python) in `services/worker/` for web scraping and future document processing.
- Webhooks: Express service in `services/webhook/` for Stripe events (forwarder; main server endpoints pending).
- Data: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (`shared/schema.ts`), but the API currently stores application data in-memory.
- Auth: Replit OIDC with `passport` + PostgreSQL-backed sessions.
- AI: OpenAI preferred with Gemini fallback.

## Key Components

- `server/`
  - `index.ts`: Express app, middleware, error handling, dev Vite integration.
  - `routes.ts`: REST endpoints for auth, dashboard, jobs, documents, chat, billing, subscriptions.
  - `storage.ts`: In-memory storage (`MemStorage`) for app data; replace with DB-backed storage.
  - `openai.ts`: OpenAI client with Gemini fallback and helpers.
  - `replitAuth.ts`: Replit OIDC configuration and session management.

- `services/worker/`
  - `main.py`: FastAPI app with CORS and health check; routers for scrape/upload/chat/visualise.
  - `app/core/scraper.py`: Async web scraper with robots.txt support, content/link/image extraction.

- `services/webhook/`
  - `index.ts`: Stripe webhook receiver forwarding events to main app (pending endpoints).

- `shared/schema.ts`: Drizzle schema for users, jobs, documents, conversations, messages, credits, plans, subscriptions, assets, audit logs.

- `apps/chatcrawler/`: Next.js app (App Router) with dashboard, chat, documents, and scrape pages; DB client using Drizzle.

- `client/`: Vite + React application using shadcn/ui.

## Current Limitations

- Application data stored in-memory â€” no persistence for users/jobs/docs/conversations/credits.
- No input validation middleware or rate limiting on the API.
- Stripe lifecycle webhooks not integrated into the main server.
- Worker stores job status/results in-process memory; no DB updates.

See the blueprint document for a migration path to a Next.js 15 Turborepo and production readiness steps.
