# ChatCrawler

## Overview

ChatCrawler is a modern, AI-powered web scraping and chat platform built with a server-first, type-safe architecture. It combines intelligent web scraping capabilities with advanced AI chat functionality, allowing users to extract content from websites, upload documents, and interact with their data through natural language conversations. The platform is designed for production use with enterprise-grade security, scalable infrastructure, and a comprehensive billing system.

## User Preferences
