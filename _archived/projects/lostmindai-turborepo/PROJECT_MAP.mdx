## Implementation Status (Reference only)

Always cross-check the canonical progress tracker before acting. Highlights below mirror `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md`:

### ✅ Foundations in place

- Turborepo + pnpm workspace configured
- Shared tooling packages (`config`, `ui`, parts of `auth`) available
- Docker Compose stack covers Postgres, Redis, Next.js apps, FastAPI

### 🧪 Active development

- `apps/ask`: Orb UI live; visitor-token security + persistence work planned
- `services/ai-compute`: IAM + Redis scaffolding present; tests/deployment pending
- `packages/ai-clients`, `packages/billing`, `packages/db`: functional stubs requiring completion

### 📋 Planned (not yet shipped)

- Additional apps (`private-docs`, `chatcrawler`, `justdropit`, `admin`)
- New packages (`security`, `rag`, `utils`)
- Additional FastAPI services (`document-processor`, `crawler-engine`, `security-monitor`)

## Git & Workflow

- Default branch: `main`
- Short‑lived feature branches, conventional commits, PRs required
- See `docs/internal/agent-tasks-prompts.md` for active, prioritized tasks (internal)
