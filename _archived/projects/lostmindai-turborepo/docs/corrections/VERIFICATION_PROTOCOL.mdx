# VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**Date Created**: 2025-09-20
**Purpose**: Prevent future misinformation and assessment errors through systematic verification methodology
**Authority**: Mandatory for all implementation status claims and architectural assessments

---

## üéØ PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

This protocol establishes **mandatory verification requirements** for all claims about implementation status, compatibility, and architecture. It was created in response to multiple rounds of conflicting assessments that created significant confusion.

**Core Principle**: **ALL CLAIMS MUST BE EVIDENCE-BASED WITH SPECIFIC FILE REFERENCES**

---

## üìã MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS

### **STEP 1: CODE EXAMINATION (REQUIRED)**

Before making **ANY** implementation claim, you MUST:

1. **Read Actual Source Files**
   - ‚úÖ Open and examine actual `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.js` files
   - ‚úÖ Count lines of implementation (not just file existence)
   - ‚úÖ Distinguish between working code and scaffolding/templates
   - ‚ùå NEVER claim implementation status based on file names alone

2. **Verify Implementation vs Scaffolding**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ WORKING IMPLEMENTATION
   async generateText(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
     const response = await this.client.generateContent({...});
     return response.text;
   }

   // ‚ùå SCAFFOLDING (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
   async generateImage(prompt: string): Promise<Uint8Array> {
     throw new Error('Not yet implemented');
   }
   ```

3. **Document Evidence Requirements**
   - **File Path**: Exact location (e.g., `packages/ai-clients/src/providers/google.ts`)
   - **Line Numbers**: Specific line references (e.g., `lines 45-67`)
   - **Code Snippets**: Actual code demonstrating functionality
   - **Line Count**: Total implementation size (e.g., "317 lines")

### **STEP 2: VERSION COMPATIBILITY VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)**

Before claiming compatibility issues:

1. **Check Actual package.json Versions**
   ```json
   {
     "react": "^19.0.0",
     "@react-three/fiber": "^8.15.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Cross-Reference Official Compatibility Matrix**
   - ‚úÖ Check library's official documentation
   - ‚úÖ Verify version compatibility claims
   - ‚úÖ Include source URLs in evidence
   - ‚ùå NEVER assume compatibility issues without verification

3. **Test Claims When Possible**
   - Run `npm install` to verify dependency resolution
   - Check for actual TypeScript/build errors
   - Document any real compatibility issues with specific error messages

### **STEP 3: CROSS-REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION (REQUIRED)**

Before making status claims:

1. **Check Multiple Documentation Sources**
   - Main README.md files
   - Individual app/package README files
   - CLAUDE.md files
   - Any planning documents

2. **Identify Inconsistencies**
   - Document conflicting claims between sources
   - Note when implementation exists but documentation says "PLANNED"
   - Flag when documentation claims implementation but code is missing

3. **Resolve with Code Evidence**
   - Code examination is the authoritative source
   - Documentation should be updated to match reality
   - Mark inconsistencies for correction

### **STEP 4: ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT (REQUIRED)**

Before criticizing architectural decisions:

1. **Understand Design Intent**
   - Different apps may intentionally have different patterns
   - Security requirements vary by application
   - Not all inconsistency is architectural problems

2. **Provide Specific Examples**
   - File paths showing the pattern
   - Explanation of why it's problematic
   - Proposed solution with justification

3. **Distinguish Architecture vs Configuration**
   - Missing docker services = configuration issue
   - Different auth patterns = architectural choice
   - Missing features = implementation gap, not architecture flaw

---

## üö® EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

### **ALL CLAIMS MUST INCLUDE:**

1. **File References**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå BAD: "AI-clients package not implemented"
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "AI-clients package partially implemented:
   - File: packages/ai-clients/src/providers/google.ts (350 lines)
   - Working: generateText() method (lines 46-102)
   - Not Working: generateImage() throws 'not implemented' error (line 183)"
   ```

2. **Version Evidence**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå BAD: "React 19 compatibility issues"
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "React 19.0.0 + @react-three/fiber ^8.15.0 are compatible:
   - Evidence: package.json shows these versions
   - Verification: React Three Fiber docs confirm React 19 support
   - Source: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/releases"
   ```

3. **Implementation Proof**
   ```markdown
   ‚ùå BAD: "Document processor service missing"
   ‚úÖ GOOD: "Document processor service exists but missing from docker:
   - Implementation: services/document-processor/main.py (317 lines)
   - Features: JWT auth, tenant isolation, background tasks
   - Gap: Missing from docker-compose.yml configuration"
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RED FLAGS (IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION REQUIRED)

### **Claims That Often Indicate Misinformation:**

1. **"Zero Implementation" Claims**
   - Usually means assessor didn't examine actual code
   - Often applied to packages with substantial scaffolding
   - **Verification**: Read actual source files, count implementation lines

2. **"Compatibility Issues" Without Specifics**
   - Often based on assumptions, not testing
   - Usually lacks version number verification
   - **Verification**: Check actual versions, test dependency resolution

3. **"Missing Service" Claims**
   - Often means service exists but configuration missing
   - Confusion between implementation and deployment setup
   - **Verification**: Check services/ directory, examine actual code

4. **"Architectural Inconsistency" Claims**
   - Often misunderstands intentional design diversity
   - Applies single pattern expectations to diverse use cases
   - **Verification**: Understand business requirements for each app

### **Language Patterns Requiring Extra Verification:**

- "Complete architecture, ZERO implementation"
- "Breaking changes" without version specifics
- "Missing microservice" without examining services/ directory
- "Hardcoded values" without checking environment variable usage
- "Not production ready" without specific technical justification
