# Claude Code Session Templates for Beginners

## 🚀 Starting a New Session

Always begin your Claude Code session with this template:

```
Please start by:
1. Running `git status` to check the current state
2. Creating a checkpoint commit with `pnpm run checkpoint`
3. Running `pnpm run safety` to check for issues
4. Using TodoWrite to list all tasks for this session

Then proceed with: [YOUR ACTUAL REQUEST]
```

## 🔧 Common Task Templates

### Adding a New Feature
```
I need to add [FEATURE NAME]. Please:
1. Break this into small, reversible steps
2. Create a git commit after each major step
3. Explain what you're doing in simple terms
4. Test that the app still works after each change
5. Let me know if there are any risks

The feature should: [DESCRIBE REQUIREMENTS]
```

### Fixing a Bug
```
There's a bug where [DESCRIBE THE ISSUE]. Please:
1. First investigate the cause without making changes
2. Explain what's wrong in simple terms
3. Propose a fix and explain potential side effects
4. Make the minimal change needed to fix it
5. Test that the fix works and doesn't break anything else
```

### Updating Dependencies
```
Please update the project dependencies:
1. First check which packages are outdated
2. Identify any with security vulnerabilities
3. Update only patch and minor versions (not major)
4. Test that everything still works after updates
5. Create a checkpoint before and after updates
```

## 🚨 Before Major Changes

Use this template before database changes, authentication updates, or payment integration:

```
I need to [DESCRIBE MAJOR CHANGE]. Before proceeding:
1. Explain the risks and what could go wrong
2. Create a detailed backup plan
3. List all files that will be changed
4. Create a checkpoint with tag for easy rollback
5. Proceed only after I confirm

Requirements: [DETAILED REQUIREMENTS]
```

## 🌐 Before Deployment

```
Please prepare for deployment:
1. Run `pnpm run pre-deploy` to validate everything
2. Check for any exposed secrets or API keys
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Create a deployment checkpoint
5. List any manual steps I need to do
6. Deploy to staging/preview first

Target environment: [staging/production]
```

## 📊 Daily Progress Review

At the end of each day:

```
Please provide a daily summary:
1. What was accomplished today (list all changes)
2. Any issues or blockers encountered
3. Current state of the application
4. What still needs to be done
5. Update docs/project/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md
6. Create an end-of-day checkpoint
```

## 🔍 Code Review Request

```
Please review the recent changes:
1. Check for security issues
2. Identify any code that could be improved
3. Look for potential bugs
4. Verify best practices are followed
5. Suggest improvements (but don't implement yet)
```

## 🆘 Emergency Recovery

If something is broken:

```
EMERGENCY: The app is broken. Please:
1. Don't make any changes yet
2. Run `git status` and `git log -5` to see recent changes
3. Identify what's broken and what caused it
4. Propose the safest way to fix or rollback
5. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding

The issue is: [DESCRIBE WHAT'S BROKEN]
```

## 💡 Learning Mode

When you want to understand something:

```
Please explain [CONCEPT/CODE] to me:
1. Use simple, non-technical language
2. Provide a practical example from our codebase
3. Explain why it's done this way
4. Show me where it's used in our project
5. Suggest resources if I want to learn more
```

## 📝 Documentation Request

```
Please document [FEATURE/COMPONENT]:
1. Explain what it does in simple terms
2. Show example usage
3. List any important configuration
4. Note any limitations or gotchas
5. Add to appropriate docs file
```

## 🔄 Refactoring Code

```
Please refactor [FILE/COMPONENT]:
1. First explain what needs improvement and why
2. Make incremental changes with commits
3. Ensure functionality stays exactly the same
4. Run tests after each change
5. Keep the old code commented until verified
```

## 🧪 Testing Template

```
Please add tests for [FEATURE/COMPONENT]:
1. Explain what should be tested and why
2. Write simple, clear test cases
3. Test both success and failure cases
4. Ensure tests actually run and pass
5. Document what the tests verify
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Changes

```
I need to change [CONFIGURATION]. Please:
1. Explain what this configuration does
2. Show current vs proposed settings
3. Identify what might break
4. Make the change incrementally
5. Test that everything still works
```

## 📦 Adding a New Package

```
I want to add [PACKAGE NAME] to the project. Please:
1. Verify it's necessary and no existing solution exists
2. Check the package's security and maintenance status
3. Explain what it does and why we need it
4. Add it to the correct workspace
5. Provide a simple usage example
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands Reference

Include these in your requests when appropriate:

- `"Run safety checks first"` - Runs `pnpm run safety`
- `"Create a checkpoint"` - Runs `pnpm run checkpoint`
- `"Validate before continuing"` - Runs `pnpm run validate`
- `"Show me the current status"` - Runs `git status`
- `"What changed recently?"` - Shows recent git commits
- `"Is it safe to deploy?"` - Runs pre-deployment checks

## 🚦 Status Check Questions

Ask these regularly:

1. "Are there any uncommitted changes?"
2. "Do all tests still pass?"
3. "Are there any security warnings?"
4. "Is the build size reasonable?"
5. "Are there any TypeScript errors?"

## 📌 Important Reminders

- Always work in small, testable increments
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Test after every change
- Ask Claude Code to explain before making complex changes
- Use checkpoints before anything risky
- Never skip the safety checks
- Keep your `.env.local` file secure
- Review changes before deploying
