# Critical Environment Variables Analysis for Your LostMindAI Repository

Let me provide a comprehensive explanation of what's missing and why it's critical, with enough detail for your AI agents to verify and cross-check.

## üö® **Critical Context: Why These Variables Matter**

Based on my repository analysis and research, your architecture has **unique requirements** that aren't covered in your current environment guide. Here's the evidence-based breakdown:

***

## **1. MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your repository shows you have **separate FastAPI services** (`services/ai-compute`, `services/document-processor`) that need to communicate with your Next.js apps. This creates **service discovery and authentication challenges** that LobeChat doesn't have (since it's all in one Next.js app).

### **Missing Variables (High Priority):**

```bash
# SERVICE DISCOVERY - Your microservices need to find each other
AI_COMPUTE_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_URL="http://localhost:8001" 
CRAWLER_ENGINE_URL="http://localhost:8002"

# PRODUCTION URLs (when deployed to Google Cloud Run)
AI_COMPUTE_SERVICE_URL="https://ai-compute-coral-muse-469919-m0.a.run.app"
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `docker-compose.yml` shows services on different ports (3000, 3001, 8000)
- **File**: `infra/terraform/gcp/main.tf` shows Cloud Run services being created
- **Code**: Your frontend apps need to know where your FastAPI services are running


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your frontend apps can't communicate with your backend services. Your AI features will fail.

***

## **2. GOOGLE CLOUD RUN AUTHENTICATION**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your `services/ai-compute` service implements **Google IAM OIDC authentication** (found in your code), but your environment guide doesn't include the required authentication variables.

### **Missing Variables (Critical):**

```bash
# OIDC AUTHENTICATION - Required for service-to-service calls
OIDC_ISSUER_URL="https://accounts.google.com"
OIDC_AUDIENCE="coral-muse-469919-m0"  # Your GCP project ID
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="coral-muse-469919-m0"

# SERVICE ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `infra/terraform/gcp/main.tf` lines 200+ show OIDC service account creation
- **File**: `services/ai-compute` (referenced in your analysis) implements OIDC middleware
- **Your Tech Stack**: States "Google Cloud Run (FastAPI)" deployment


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your microservices can't authenticate with each other. All service-to-service calls will fail with 401 errors.

***

## **3. TURBOREPO-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your `turbo.json` shows task orchestration, but you're missing environment variables that Turborepo needs to know about for proper caching and builds.

### **Missing Variables (Medium Priority):**

```bash
# BUILD-TIME VARIABLES - Turborepo needs these for consistent builds
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"   # marketing app
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASK_APP_URL="http://localhost:3001"  # ask app
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"  # FastAPI backend

# DEPLOYMENT URLS (production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://lostmindai.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASK_APP_URL="https://ask.lostmindai.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="https://api.lostmindai.com"
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `turbo.json` - Your build orchestration config
- **File**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Shows multiple app workspaces
- **Research**: [Turborepo docs](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables) confirm this requirement


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your builds will be inconsistent across environments, and your frontend apps won't know how to reach your APIs.

***

## **4. FASTAPI-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your FastAPI services need specific configuration that's different from Next.js apps.

### **Missing Variables (High Priority):**

```bash
# FASTAPI CONFIGURATION - Required for your Python services
FASTAPI_ENV="development"  # development | staging | production
API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001"
MAX_WORKERS=4
WORKER_TIMEOUT=3600
UVICORN_HOST="0.0.0.0"
UVICORN_PORT=8000
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `docker-compose.yml` shows FastAPI services with specific ports
- **Directory**: `services/ai-compute` exists (FastAPI service)
- **Research**: [FastAPI environment docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/) confirm this pattern


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your FastAPI services won't start or will have incorrect CORS policies, blocking frontend communication.

***

## **5. SECURITY CONFIGURATION GAPS**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your CLAUDE.md mentions "enterprise-grade security" but your environment guide is missing security-specific variables.

### **Missing Variables (High Priority):**

```bash
# SECURITY CONFIGURATION - Your enterprise features need these
SECURITY_MODE="development"  # development | production
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL="MEDIUM"     # LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH  
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
JWT_SECRET="[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]"
GDPR_COMPLIANCE_ENABLED=false
SOC2_AUDIT_MODE=false
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **File**: `CLAUDE.md` extensively mentions security requirements
- **Architecture**: Your enterprise positioning requires audit logging
- **Code Analysis**: Security middleware mentioned in your services


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without these, your security features won't work, and you can't deliver on your enterprise security promises.

***

## **6. ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC PORT CONFLICTS**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your environment guide shows inconsistent port usage compared to your actual configuration.

### **Current Issue:**

- **Your Guide Says**: Multiple apps on port 3000
- **Your `docker-compose.yml` Shows**: Different ports (3000, 3001, 8000)


### **Missing Clarification:**

```bash
# DEVELOPMENT PORTS (from your docker-compose.yml)
MARKETING_APP_PORT=3000
ASK_APP_PORT=3001
AI_COMPUTE_PORT=8000
DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_PORT=8001
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
REDIS_PORT=6379
```


### **Why It's Critical:**

Port conflicts will prevent your services from starting locally, blocking development.

***

## **7. FEATURE FLAGS FOR INCOMPLETE FEATURES**

### **Problem Identified:**

Your repository analysis shows incomplete implementations (like `@lostmind/ai-clients` package). You need feature flags to safely develop.

### **Missing Variables (Medium Priority):**

```bash
# FEATURE FLAGS - Control incomplete features
FEATURE_FLAG_PRIVATE_DOCS=false
FEATURE_FLAG_VOICE_ENABLED=false
FEATURE_FLAG_3D_ORB=true
FEATURE_FLAG_ENTERPRISE_FEATURES=false
FEATURE_FLAG_AI_CLIENTS_PACKAGE=false  # Since it's not implemented
```


### **Evidence from Your Repository:**

- **Analysis**: Shows incomplete `@lostmind/ai-clients` implementation
- **Architecture**: Multiple planned but unimplemented apps
- **Development**: Safer to toggle features during development


### **Why It's Critical:**

Without feature flags, incomplete features will break your application.

***

## **üìã AI AGENT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

For your AI agents to verify and cross-check:

### **1. Check Repository Files:**

```bash
# Verify these files exist and check their configurations:
- docker-compose.yml (check service ports)
- turbo.json (check task configuration)
- infra/terraform/gcp/main.tf (check Cloud Run services)
- services/*/package.json (check service dependencies)
- apps/*/package.json (check app configurations)
```


### **2. Verify Service Communication:**

```bash
# Check if services can actually communicate:
- Can frontend apps reach FastAPI services?
- Are CORS headers properly configured?
- Do authentication tokens work between services?
```


### **3. Check Environment File Consistency:**

```bash
# Verify environment files match actual architecture:
- Do port numbers match docker-compose.yml?
- Are service URLs correct for your deployment?
- Do security variables match CLAUDE.md requirements?
```


### **4. Test Local Development:**

```bash
# Verify complete local stack works:
pnpm install
docker-compose up -d  # Does this start without errors?
pnpm run dev          # Do all apps start successfully?
```


## **üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

1. **Update your environment guide** with these missing variables
2. **Test your complete local stack** - many configurations might be broken
3. **Verify service-to-service communication** works with proper authentication
4. **Add environment validation script** to catch missing variables early

The core issue is that your **microservices architecture** has different requirements than simpler Next.js-only applications, but your environment guide doesn't reflect this complexity. These missing variables will cause **service discovery failures, authentication errors, and deployment issues**.

Your AI agents should verify each of these points against your actual repository structure to confirm what's missing and what needs to be implemented.
