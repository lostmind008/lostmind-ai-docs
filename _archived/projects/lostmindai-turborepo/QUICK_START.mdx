# 🚀 Beginner's Quick Start Guide for Claude Code

## Your Safety Commands (Use These Often!)

```bash
# Before starting any work
pnpm run safety          # Checks for problems

# Save your work frequently  
pnpm run checkpoint      # Creates a save point you can return to

# If something breaks
pnpm run rollback        # Undo last change
pnpm run emergency-reset # Fix everything if badly broken

# Before deploying
pnpm run pre-deploy      # Make sure everything is ready
```

## 🎯 Your First Session with Claude Code

Copy and paste this exactly:

```
Please start by:
1. Running `pnpm run safety` to check everything is OK
2. Creating a checkpoint with `pnpm run checkpoint`
3. Showing me the current project status
Then: [Tell Claude what you want to do]
```

## 📋 Daily Workflow

### Morning Start
1. Open terminal in project folder
2. Run: `git pull` (get latest code)
3. Run: `pnpm install` (update packages)
4. Run: `pnpm run safe-start` (safety check + start app)

### Before Any Major Work
Ask Claude: "Please create a checkpoint and explain what we're about to change"

### Every Hour
Run: `pnpm run checkpoint` (or ask Claude to do it)

### End of Day
Ask Claude: "Please create an end-of-day summary and checkpoint"

## 🚨 Red Flags - Stop and Ask for Help

If Claude Code wants to:
- Delete more than 3 files
- Change database structure
- Modify authentication/login code  
- Install packages you don't recognize
- Make changes to payment/billing code

**Say**: "Please stop and explain what this will do first"

## 💡 Magic Phrases to Use

- "Please explain this in simple terms"
- "Create a checkpoint first"
- "Is this safe to do?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "How do I undo this if needed?"
- "Test that it still works"

## 🛠️ If Something Breaks

Don't panic! Use this template:

```
The app is broken. Please:
1. Don't change anything yet
2. Show me what's wrong
3. Explain how to fix it safely
The problem is: [describe what you see]
```

## 📚 Your Safety Net Features

### Automatic Protections
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Checks your code before saving
- **GitHub Actions**: Tests code when you push
- **Safety script**: Warns about problems
- **Checkpoints**: Easy rollback points

### Manual Checks
- `pnpm run safety` - Run before starting work
- `pnpm run validate` - Check everything is correct
- `pnpm run checkpoint` - Save current state

## 🎯 Common Tasks Made Simple

### "I want to add a new feature"
```
I want to add [FEATURE]. Please:
1. Break it into small steps
2. Test after each step
3. Commit frequently
4. Explain what you're doing
```

### "I want to fix something"
```
There's a problem with [DESCRIBE]. Please:
1. Investigate first without changes
2. Explain the issue simply
3. Fix it carefully
4. Test the fix works
```

### "I want to deploy"
```
I want to deploy to [staging/production]. Please:
1. Run pre-deploy checks
2. List what will change
3. Deploy to staging first
4. Verify everything works
```

## 📖 Essential Files to Know

- `.env.local` - Your secret settings (NEVER share this!)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code
- `package.json` - Project configuration and scripts
- `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_TEMPLATES.md` - More templates

## ✅ Your Daily Checklist

- [ ] Started with `pnpm run safety`
- [ ] Created checkpoints before major changes
- [ ] Tested app still works after changes
- [ ] Committed code with clear messages
- [ ] No secrets or passwords in code
- [ ] Created end-of-day checkpoint

## 🚀 Remember

1. **Small steps are safer than big leaps**
2. **Commits are your save points - make lots!**
3. **When in doubt, create a checkpoint**
4. **It's OK to ask Claude to explain things**
5. **The safety scripts are your friends**

## 🆘 Getting Help

- Check `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_TEMPLATES.md` for more templates
