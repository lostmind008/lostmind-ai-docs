## 🔑 Canonical Status Statement

This document is the **single source of truth** for repository scope, implementation status, and near-term plans.  
When the codebase changes, update this file first, then point every other status summary back here.  
If another document diverges, treat this file as authoritative.

## 🚦 Snapshot

**Implemented foundations**

- Turborepo + pnpm workspace layout with shared packages (`config`, `ui`, `db`, `auth`, `ai-clients`, `billing`).
- Two Next.js 15 apps: `apps/marketing` (public marketing shell) and `apps/ask` (orb experience scaffold).
- `services/ai-compute` FastAPI service with Google IAM-compatible auth hooks, Redis rate limiting, and new `google-genai` SDK integration (requires production hardening).
- Docker Compose stack for Postgres, Redis, Ask, Marketing, and AI Compute services.
- Security scaffolding in `packages/auth` (NextAuth + middleware) and Redis-backed rate limiting bridge.

**In progress**

- Restoring dependable testing (Vitest smoke tests need fixes; FastAPI lacks pytest coverage).
- Establishing CI scripts for lint/type-check/test (currently manual).
- Aligning documentation, security commands, and scripts with actual implementation.

**Planned / not yet delivered**

- Additional apps (`private-docs`, `chatcrawler`, `justdropit`, `admin`).
- Additional packages (`security`, `rag`, `utils`) and FastAPI services (`document-processor`, `crawler-engine`, `security-monitor`).
- Full billing workflows, production-ready Stripe webhooks, and automated deploy pipeline.

Keep aspirational content in this “Planned” section until code lands in `main`.

## 🎯 Focus Initiative — ask.lostmindai.com

**Experience Contract**

- Preserve the current 3D orb UI and interactions exactly as deployed at ask.lostmindai.com.
- Visitors must land, see the orb, and start chatting immediately without sign-up, checkboxes, or gating.

**Security & Data Plan**

1. Issue short-lived, signed visitor tokens automatically on first load (HTTP-only cookie). No manual auth flow.
2. Accept visitor tokens in chat APIs alongside authenticated sessions; enforce Redis-backed quotas per visitor tier.
3. Persist transcripts and “leave a message” intents via Prisma so the assistant can brief Sumit later.
4. Enable OpenAI Live voice streaming using the same visitor token for authorization.
5. Flip `REQUIRE_AUTH` to `true` by default in `services/ai-compute` and treat visitor tokens as scoped identities.
6. Instrument usage logging for per-visitor analytics and daily AI-generated summaries.

Document each step here as it ships so the rest of the repo stays aligned.

## ✅ Verified Hygiene

- Documentation hub at `docs/` is organized and cross-linked (navigation breadcrumbs intact).
- Root contains only canonical high-level docs (README, CLAUDE, AGENTS, ROADMAP, PROGRESS_UPDATE).
- Google GenAI migration guardrails exist (husky, documentation), though production usage still pending validation.

## 🚧 Immediate Action Items

1. **Visitor session auth layer** — Extend `@lostmind/auth` with visitor token issuance/verification, flip `REQUIRE_AUTH` default, and update chat API guards. Add Vitest + Pytest coverage proving both visitor and authenticated flows.
2. **Transcript + message persistence** — Define Prisma models, capture chat turns/messages, and expose an internal digest endpoint for daily summaries.
3. **Testing & CI baseline** — Repair existing Vitest suite, add FastAPI smoke tests, and wire lint/type-check/test into CI (GitHub Actions or Turbo pipeline).
4. **Documentation sync** — After each milestone above, upd
