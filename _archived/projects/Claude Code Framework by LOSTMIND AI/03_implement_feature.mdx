# This is the primary prompt for implementing a new feature.
# The user should replace the bracketed text with their feature description.

Our goal is to implement the following feature: "[DESCRIBE THE FEATURE BRIEFLY, INCLUDING THE USER BENEFIT. For example: 'a user profile page where users can update their email and password to keep their account secure']".

This is a standard feature development task. Please begin the development workflow by analyzing the request and proposing a plan.
