# Command: /ucf-create-task-brief

## Your Role: Task Brief Generator with Claude Code Integration

Transform high-level user requests into detailed, structured Task Briefing documents using the LostMind AI engine. Leverage Claude Code's project context and file system access for optimal integration.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Validate Claude Code Environment:** Ensure LostMind AI framework integration is available:
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_framework"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installation first."
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

2.  **Process Task Description:** Extract and validate the user's task description from arguments.

3.  **Generate Task Briefing:** Execute the LostMind AI engine to create the initial brief:
    ```bash
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" create_brief "$ARGUMENTS"
    ```

4.  **Enhance with Project Context:** After generation, use Claude Code's file access to:
    - Read the generated briefing file
    - Analyze current project structure and context  
    - Fill in detailed technical specifications
    - Add project-specific implementation details
    - Update timeline estimates based on existing codebase

5.  **Validate and Present:** Present the completed Task Briefing to the user with:
    - Summary of key requirements and deliverables
    - Integration points with existing project structure
    - Recommendation for agent delegation using `/ucf-delegate-task`
