# Project Context Priming Command

Load and analyze comprehensive project context to optimize Claude's understanding and performance for the current codebase.

## Context Analysis Process

1. **Project Discovery**:
   - Analyze project structure and architecture patterns
   - Identify technology stack and frameworks
   - Detect build tools, package managers, and dependencies
   - Map directory structure and file organization
   - Identify key configuration files and settings

2. **Codebase Understanding**:
   - Scan entry points and main application files
   - Analyze API endpoints and route definitions
   - Identify data models, schemas, and database structure
   - Map component hierarchies and dependencies
   - Detect testing strategies and coverage

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Parse package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.
   - Analyze Docker configurations and deployment scripts
   - Identify CI/CD pipelines and automation
   - Map environment variables and configuration
   - Understand development and deployment workflows

## Context Categories

### **Architecture & Design**
- Overall system architecture and patterns
- Service boundaries and microservice organization
- Database design and relationships
- API design patterns and conventions
- Frontend component architecture

### **Technology Stack**
- Programming languages and versions
- Frameworks and libraries in use
- Build tools and bundlers
- Testing frameworks and strategies
- Deployment and infrastructure tools

### **Code Patterns & Conventions**
- Naming conventions and style guides
- Error handling patterns
- Authentication and authorization approaches
- Logging and monitoring strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### **Business Logic & Domain**
- Core business entities and relationships
- User workflows and use cases
- Integration points and external services
- Data flow and processing logic
- Security requirements and implementations

## Priming Modes

### **Standard Priming** (Default)
```bash
/prime
```
- Analyze project structure and main files
- Identify technology stack and patterns
- Load key configuration and documentation
- Generate concise context summary

### **Deep Analysis**
```bash
/prime --deep
```
- Comprehensive codebase analysis
- Detailed dependency mapping
- Performance and security assessment
- Complete architectural documentation
- Generate detailed context map

### **Focused Priming**
```bash
/prime --focus=frontend
/prime --focus=backend
/prime --focus=auth
/prime --focus=api
```
- Target specific areas or domains
- Deep dive into focused components
- Load relevant documentation and patterns
- Optimize for specific development tasks

### **Context Update**
```bash
/prime --update
```
- Refresh existing context with recent changes
- Analyze new files and modifications
- Update technology stack understanding
- Maintain context freshness during development

## Context Output

### **Project Summary**
```markdown
# Project: [Name] - [Type]

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.11, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS, Terraform
- **Testing**: Pytest, Playwright, Jest

## Architecture Overview
- [High-level architecture description]
- [Key design patterns and principles]
- [Service organization and boundaries]

## Key Areas
- Authentication: OAuth2 + JWT implementation
- API: RESTful with OpenAPI documentation  
- Database: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations
- Frontend: Server components with client hydration
```

### **Development Context**
- Current development priorities
- Recent changes and ongoing work
- Known issues and technical debt
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements

### **Agent Optimization**
Based on project analysis, automatically configure:
- Relevant sub-agents for the technology stack
- Quality gates appropriate for the project
- Testing strategies matching current setup
- Performance optimization focus areas
- Security considerations for the domain

## Memory Integration

### **Persistent Context**
- Store project context in `~/.claude/memory/projects/[project-name]/`
- Create project-specific CLAUDE.md with key insights
- Build searchable knowledge base of patterns and decisions
- Maintain version history of architectural changes

### **Context Refresh**
- Monitor file system changes for context updates
- Automatically refresh when package.json or dependencies change
- Update context when new major files are added
- Maintain context freshness without re-analyzing entire codebase

## Integration with Development Workflow

### **IDE Integration**
- Export context for IDE extensions and plugins
- Generate project documentation from context analysis
- Create development environment setup guides
- Provide onboarding materials for new team members

### **Team Collaboration**
- Share context insights with team members
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Create searchable knowledge b
