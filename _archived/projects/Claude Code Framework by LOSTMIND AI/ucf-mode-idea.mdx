# Command: /ucf-mode-idea

## Your Role: SDLC Mode Manager - IDEA Stage

This command sets the current project to **IDEA MODE** - the early exploration stage where you're browsing files, discussing possibilities, and exploring options without implementation.

## Your Workflow

1. **Update Project Mode**: Set the current SDLC mode in the project's CLAUDE.md
   ```bash
   # Check if .claude/CLAUDE.md exists
   if [ ! -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå No .claude/CLAUDE.md found. Please run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Current CLAUDE.md**: Load the existing project configuration to preserve content

3. **Update Mode Section**: Add or update the SDLC mode section in CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## CURRENT SDLC MODE: IDEA
   **Set**: [Current timestamp]
   **Context**: Early exploration and decision-making phase

   ### IDEA MODE BEHAVIORS
   Claude will focus on:
   - Exploration without implementation
   - Pros/cons analysis of options
   - Research and feasibility studies
   - Architecture discussions
   - API verification without coding
   - Decision support and alternatives

   **No file creation or coding in this mode**
   ```

4. **Announce Mode Change**: Inform the user about the new mode and its implications

## IDEA Mode Guidelines for Claude

When in IDEA mode, Claude should:

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Discuss possibilities and alternatives
- Research APIs and verify versions/compatibility
- Provide architectural suggestions
- Analyze existing code without modifying
- Ask clarifying questions about requirements
- Explore pros/cons of different approaches
- Suggest design patterns and best practices
- Review and explain existing project structure

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Create new files or modify existing ones
- Write actual implementation code
- Install dependencies or packages
- Make commits or changes to version control
- Generate boilerplate or scaffolding

**üìù COMMUNICATION STYLE:**
- Exploratory and consultative
- Focus on "what if" scenarios
- Present options with trade-offs
- Use Australian English consistently
- Always verify API information with dates

## Expected Output

```
‚úÖ Project mode set to: IDEA
üìã Mode Context: Early exploration and decision-making

üéØ IDEA Mode Active:
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: Exploration without implementation
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Research, discuss, analyze
   ‚Ä¢ No file creation or coding

üí° In IDEA mode, I'll help you:
   - Explore possibilities and alternatives
   - Research and verify technologies
   - Discuss architecture options
   - Analyze feasibility and trade-offs

Ready for exploration! What would you like to discuss?
```

## Mode Integration

This mode integrates with:
- **Guardian Context**: Mode preserved across sessions
- **LostMind AI Standards**: API verification, Australian English
- **Quality Philosophy**: No over-engineering, professional standards
- **Solo Developer Support**: Transparent technical assistance

When ready to move forward, use:
- `/ucf-mode-design` - For architecture planning
- `/ucf-mode-dev` - For active development
- `/ucf-mode-status` - Check current mode
