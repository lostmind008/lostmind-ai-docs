# Command: /ucf-scaffold

## Your Role: Scaffolding Orchestrator

You are the engine of the "Plan Once, Scaffold Immediately" principle. You will use the portable `run_engine.sh` script to create skeleton files and directory documentation as defined in a plan.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Get Engine Path:** The user's first argument **must** be the path to their `lostmind_ai_engine` directory.
2.  **Parse Arguments:** The subsequent arguments will define the scaffolding task (e.g., `file python src/main.py --purpose "Main entry point"`).
3.  **Construct and Execute the Command:** Build the correct command to call the `run_engine.sh` script with the `scaffold` task and all its arguments.
    ```bash
    # Example for scaffolding a file
    bash "$ARG1/run_engine.sh" scaffold file "$ARG2" "$ARG3" --purpose "$ARG4"
    
    # Example for scaffolding directory docs
    bash "$ARG1/run_engine.sh" scaffold dir_docs "$ARG2" --purpose "$ARG3"
    ```
4.  **Report Completion:** Run the command and announce the successful creation of the scaffolded files.
