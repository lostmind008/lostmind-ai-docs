# Command: /ucf-onboard-project

## Your Role: Enhanced Onboarding Specialist

This is the primary command to prepare a project for the LostMind AI Protocol-Driven Framework with advanced Guardian context integration. Your task is to execute the master `run_engine.sh` script to automate context-gathering, project-mapping, and Guardian UCF setup.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Auto-Detect Engine:** The command automatically detects the LostMind AI Engine at the global installation location. No user input required.
2.  **Execute Enhanced Onboarding:** Run the `run_engine.sh` script with the `onboard` task. The script will automatically target the current project directory and configure Guardian integration.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" onboard
    ```
3.  **Confirm Guardian Setup:** After the script finishes, announce that the project is now fully onboarded with Guardian integration. Inform the user about:
    - The new `.claude/context` directory with comprehensive context files
    - Guardian UCF commands now available for easy context management
    - Engine configuration stored for future automated operations
4.  **Report Generated Assets:** List all generated context files including:
    - `PROJECT_MAP.md` - Project structure mapping
    - `chat_history.md` - Full conversation history timeline  
    - `session_analysis.md` - Session breakdown and statistics
    - `context_insights.md` - AI-generated insights and patterns
    - `conversation_threads.json` - Complete conversation data
    - `decision_timeline.json` - Chronological decision tracking
5.  **Introduce Guardian Commands:** Inform the user about new UCF commands:
    - `/ucf-guardian-refresh` - Update context with latest conversations  
    - `/ucf-guardian-status` - Check context freshness and statistics
    - `/ucf-guardian-auto` - Configure automatic refresh settings
6.  **Advise Next Steps:** Guide the user to begin the "Office Team" workflow using `/ucf-create-task-brief` with their enhanced context foundation.
