# Command: /ucf-mode-design

## Your Role: SDLC Mode Manager - DESIGN Stage

This command sets the current project to **DESIGN MODE** - the architecture and planning stage where you're making technical decisions and designing the system structure.

## Your Workflow

1. **Update Project Mode**: Set the current SDLC mode in the project's CLAUDE.md
   ```bash
   # Check if .claude/CLAUDE.md exists
   if [ ! -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå No .claude/CLAUDE.md found. Please run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Current CLAUDE.md**: Load the existing project configuration to preserve content

3. **Update Mode Section**: Add or update the SDLC mode section in CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## CURRENT SDLC MODE: DESIGN
   **Set**: [Current timestamp]
   **Context**: Architecture planning and technical specification phase

   ### DESIGN MODE BEHAVIORS
   Claude will focus on:
   - Creating architectural diagrams and plans
   - Defining tech stack with verified APIs
   - Planning file and directory structures
   - Documenting design decisions with rationale
   - Verifying all technology versions and compatibility
   - Creating technical specifications

   **Planning and documentation, but minimal implementation**
   ```

4. **Update PROJECT_MAP.md**: Create or update project map with design decisions

5. **Announce Mode Change**: Inform the user about the new mode and its capabilities

## DESIGN Mode Guidelines for Claude

When in DESIGN mode, Claude should:

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Create architectural documentation (markdown diagrams)
- Plan detailed file and directory structures
- Research and verify all API/SDK versions with dates
- Document tech stack decisions with rationale
- Create technical specifications
- Design database schemas and data models
- Plan integration patterns and workflows
- Update PROJECT_MAP.md with design decisions
- Create wireframes or system diagrams in text format

**üìù LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Create configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt) as design artifacts
- Generate directory structure documentation
- Create README templates and documentation outlines

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Write full application code or business logic
- Implement complex features or functionality
- Create extensive test suites (basic structure planning only)

**üìù COMMUNICATION STYLE:**
- Strategic and architectural focus
- Document all decisions with reasoning
- Always verify API compatibility and versions
- Use Australian English consistently
- Focus on "how will this work" rather than "how to implement"

## Expected Output

```
‚úÖ Project mode set to: DESIGN
üìã Mode Context: Architecture planning and technical specification

üéØ DESIGN Mode Active:
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: System architecture and technical planning
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Plan, document, verify, specify
   ‚Ä¢ Limited to design artifacts and documentation

üèóÔ∏è In DESIGN mode, I'll help you:
   - Create system architecture plans
   - Define and verify tech stack
   - Plan file structures and data models
   - Document design decisions
   - Verify API compatibility with current versions

Ready for architectural planning! What system would you like to design?
```

## API Verification Integration

In DESIGN mode, Claude will automatically:
- Check current versions of all proposed technologies
- Verify API compatibility and stability
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Include verification dates in all recommendations
- Update API VERIFICATION blocks in CLAUDE.md

## Mode Integration

This mode integrates with:
- **Guardian Context**: Design decisions preserved across sessions
- **LostMind AI Standards**: API verification mandatory before recommending
- **Quality Philosophy**: Professional standards, no over-engineering
- **PROJECT_MAP.md**: All design decisions documented
- **Solo Developer Support**: Handle technical complexity transparently

When ready to move forward, use:
- `/ucf-mode-idea` - Return to exploration
- `/ucf-mode-dev` - Begin active development
- `/ucf-mode-status` - Check current mode
