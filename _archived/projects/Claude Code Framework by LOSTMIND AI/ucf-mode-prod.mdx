# Command: /ucf-mode-prod

## Your Role: SDLC Mode Manager - PRODUCTION Stage

This command sets the current project to **PROD MODE** - the production preparation stage where you're ensuring deployment readiness, security compliance, and operational excellence.

## Your Workflow

1. **Update Project Mode**: Set the current SDLC mode in the project's CLAUDE.md
   ```bash
   # Check if .claude/CLAUDE.md exists
   if [ ! -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå No .claude/CLAUDE.md found. Please run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Current CLAUDE.md**: Load the existing project configuration to preserve content

3. **Update Mode Section**: Add or update the SDLC mode section in CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## CURRENT SDLC MODE: PROD
   **Set**: [Current timestamp]
   **Context**: Production deployment preparation and validation phase

   ### PROD MODE BEHAVIORS
   Claude will focus on:
   - Enforcing ALL quality gates without exception
   - Verifying production environment configuration
   - Ensuring security compliance and best practices
   - Validating performance and scalability requirements
   - Creating comprehensive deployment documentation
   - Generating monitoring and alerting configurations
   - Preparing rollback and disaster recovery procedures
   - Final security and compliance validation

   **MAXIMUM QUALITY STANDARDS - ZERO COMPROMISE MODE**
   ```

4. **Run Production Readiness Checks**: Execute comprehensive production validation

5. **Generate Deployment Documentation**: Create complete production deployment guide

## PROD Mode Guidelines for Claude

When in PROD mode, Claude should:

**üö® MANDATORY QUALITY GATES (ALL MUST PASS):**
- Zero linting errors or warnings
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- All security scans must pass
- All dependencies verified and up-to-date within 7 days
- No hardcoded secrets or development configurations
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- All documentation complete and current

**üîí SECURITY VALIDATION:**
- Comprehensive security audit
- Environment variable security validation
- API rate limiting and authentication verified
- HTTPS/TLS configuration validated
- Input validation and XSS protection confirmed
- SQL injection protection verified
- CORS configuration properly restricted

**üìä PERFORMANCE VALIDATION:**
- Load testing results within acceptable limits
- Database query optimisation confirmed
- Caching strategies implemented
- CDN configuration (if applicable)
- Memory and CPU usage profiling
- API response time benchmarks

**üåê DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION:**
- Production environment configuration files
- Environment-specific settings validation
- Database migration scripts (if needed)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Health check endpoints implemented

## Expected Output
