# Command: /ucf-mode-test

## Your Role: SDLC Mode Manager - TESTING Stage

This command sets the current project to **TEST MODE** - the quality assurance stage where you're ensuring code quality, running comprehensive tests, and validating readiness for deployment.

## Your Workflow

1. **Update Project Mode**: Set the current SDLC mode in the project's CLAUDE.md
   ```bash
   # Check if .claude/CLAUDE.md exists
   if [ ! -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       echo "❌ No .claude/CLAUDE.md found. Please run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Current CLAUDE.md**: Load the existing project configuration to preserve content

3. **Update Mode Section**: Add or update the SDLC mode section in CLAUDE.md:
   ```markdown
   ## CURRENT SDLC MODE: TEST
   **Set**: [Current timestamp]
   **Context**: Quality assurance and pre-deployment validation phase

   ### TEST MODE BEHAVIORS
   Claude will focus on:
   - Running all linters and formatters automatically
   - Checking for missing or outdated dependencies
   - Verifying all API versions are current and compatible
   - Generating comprehensive test suites
   - Checking for security vulnerabilities
   - Ensuring complete documentation
   - Validating error handling and edge cases
   - Performance testing and optimization

   **Quality gates enforced before any deployment consideration**
   ```

4. **Run Quality Checks**: Execute comprehensive quality validation

5. **Generate Test Report**: Create detailed testing summary

## TEST Mode Guidelines for Claude

When in TEST mode, Claude should:

**🔍 AUTOMATIC QUALITY CHECKS (Run immediately):**
- Execute all linters (ESLint, Prettier, Black, Ruff, etc.)
- Check dependency versions and security vulnerabilities
- Verify all APIs are using current, stable versions
- Run existing test suites and report coverage
- Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Validate environment variable usage
- Scan for performance bottlenecks

**🧪 TEST GENERATION:**
- Create missing unit tests for critical functions
- Generate integration tests for API endpoints
- Add edge case and error handling tests
- Create performance/load testing scenarios
- Implement mock data and test fixtures

**📋 DOCUMENTATION VALIDATION:**
- Ensure all functions have proper documentation
- Verify API documentation is current with code
- Check README.md completeness and accuracy
- Validate code comments are in Australian English
- Confirm all API VERIFICATION blocks are current

**🔒 SECURITY CHECKS:**
- Scan for common security vulnerabilities
- Verify proper input validation and sanitisation
- Check authentication and authorisation implementations
- Validate HTTPS usage and security headers
- Review error message information disclosure

## Expected Output

```

## Comprehensive Quality Checklist

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] All linters pass (ESLint, Prettier, Black, etc.)
- [ ] Type checking passes (TypeScript, mypy)
- [ ] No code smells or duplications
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout

**Testing:**
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration tests for all APIs
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios covered
- [ ] Performance tests for critical paths

**Security:**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation and sanitisation
- [ ] Proper authentication/authorisation
- [ ] Security headers configured

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] All packages up to date
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities
- [ ] API versions verified within 30 days
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed

**Documentation:**
- [ ] All functions documented
- [ ] README.md complete and accurate
- [ ] API documentation current
- [ ] Australian English used consistently

## API Verification in TEST Mode

Claude will automatically:
- Check all API/SDK versions are current
- Verify no deprecated APIs are in use
- Update API VERIFICATION blocks with current dates
- Test API connectivity and responses
- Validate API rate limits and error handling

## Mode Integration

This mode integrates with:
- **Guardian Context**: Test results preserved across sessions
- **LostMind AI Standards**: Full quality compliance enforced
- **Quality Philosophy**: Professional standards without over-engineering
- **Solo Developer Support**: Comprehensive quality automation

## Automated Tools Integration

Claude will run:
```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript projects
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test
npm audit

# Python projects
black --chec
