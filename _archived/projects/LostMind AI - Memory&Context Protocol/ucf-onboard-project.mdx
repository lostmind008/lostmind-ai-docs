# Command: /ucf-onboard-project

## Your Role: Onboarding Specialist

This is the primary command to prepare a project for the LostMind AI Protocol-Driven Framework. Your task is to execute the master `run_engine.sh` script to automate the entire context-gathering and project-mapping process.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Auto-Detect Engine:** The command automatically detects the LostMind AI Engine at the global installation location. No user input required.
2.  **Execute the Engine:** Run the `run_engine.sh` script with the `onboard` task. The script will automatically target the current project directory.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" onboard
    ```
3.  **Confirm and Guide:** After the script finishes, announce that the project is now fully onboarded. Inform the user that a new `.lostmind_ai_context` directory has been created in their project.
4.  **Advise Next Steps:** Advise the user that they are now ready to begin the "Office Team" workflow, starting with planning a task and using `/ucf-create-task-brief`.
