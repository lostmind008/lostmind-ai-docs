# Claude Code Best Practices

This guide outlines best practices for effectively using Claude Code and MCP tools based on community feedback, official recommendations, and practical experience.

## Project Organization

### Documentation with CLAUDE.md

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root to help Claude understand your codebase:

```markdown
# Project Overview for Claude

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Contains source code
  - `components/` - React components
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `docs/` - Documentation files

## Coding Standards
- We use ESLint with Airbnb config
- Follow semantic commit messages
- Branch naming: feature/descriptive-name or fix/issue-reference

## Key Dependencies
- React 18
- TypeScript 5.0
- Express 4.18

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Build for production
```

Claude automatically pulls this file into context when starting a conversation, making it an ideal place for:
- Project structure
- Coding conventions
- Repository etiquette
- Common commands and workflows
- Key architectural decisions

### Project-Specific Configuration

For complex projects, maintain a `.claude-code` directory with additional context:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude-code
touch .claude-code/architecture.md
touch .claude-code/workflows.md
```

Reference these files when needed:
```bash
claude "Explain our authentication flow based on .claude-code/architecture.md"
```

## Effective Prompting

### Be Specific and Contextual

Good:
```bash
claude "Refactor the user authentication logic in src/auth/userAuth.js to use async/await instead of promises"
```

Better:
```bash
claude "Refactor the user authentication logic in src/auth/userAuth.js to use async/await instead of promises. Maintain the existing error handling patterns and ensure all tests in tests/auth still pass."
```

### Use Multi-Turn Interactions

Break complex tasks into steps:

1. Start with context:
   ```bash
   claude "I want to add a new API endpoint for user profile updates"
   ```

2. Ask follow-up questions:
   ```bash
   # After Claude responds
   What validation should I add for email fields?
   ```

3. Refine the implementation:
   ```bash
   # After getting the code
   Update this to include rate limiting
   ```

### Leverage Claude's Capabilities

For code exploration:
```bash
claude "Analyze our codebase and list potential security vulnerabilities in our API endpoints"
```

For explaining complex code:
```bash
claude "Explain how our React context system works, focusing on the ThemeProvider in src/context/ThemeContext.js"
```

## MCP Tool Usage

### Security Best Practices

1. **Tool Allowlisting**
   ```bash
   # Start with restrictive permissions
   /allowed-tools clear
   
   # Add only what you need
   /allowed-tools add Read
   /allowed-tools add Bash(ls:*)
   ```

2. **Filesystem Access**
   - Limit access to specific directories
   - Never expose sensitive credentials or key files

3. **Git Operations**
   - Use allowlisting for specific git operations:
     ```bash
     /allowed-tools add Bash(git status:*)
     /allowed-tools add Bash(git diff:*)
     ```
   - Be cautious with commit and push operations
   - Consider using a separate branch for Claude-assisted work

### Structured Workflows

#### Code Review Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Start Claude Code
claude "Review the changes in the feature/user-auth branch compared to main. Focus on security issues and test coverage."
```

#### Bug Investigation Workflow

```bash
# Start with error details
claude "Help debug the error: 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user')' that occurs when logging in."

# Allow Claude to explore the codebase
/allowed-tools add Read
/allowed-tools add Bash(grep:*)

# Let Claude run specific tests
/allowed-tools add Bash(npm test:*)
```

#### Feature Development Workflow

```bash
# Start with a feature specification
claude "Let's implement a password reset feature with email verification."

# Collaborative implementation
/allowed-tools add Edit

# Test and refine
/allowed-tools add Bash(npm test:*)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Optimize Context Usage

1. **Be selective with file sharing**
   - Share only relevant files rather than entire directories
   - For large codebases, focus on specific modules

2. **Clear context when switching tasks**
   ```bash
   # Start a fresh conversation
   claude --clear
   ```

3. **Use code snippets for large files**
   ```bash
   # Instead of sharing entire large files
   claude "Help me optimize this function:"
   ```
   Then paste just the relevant code section.

### Efficient Tool Configuration

1. **Only enable necessary MCP tools**
   - Disable browser automation when not needed
   - Use targeted file access instead of broad directory permissions

2. **Set appropriate timeouts for operations**
   ```json
   {
     "n
