# Integration Orchestrator

Coordinate systematic integration of parallel development tracks, ensuring quality, compatibility, and seamless deployment of distributed development efforts.

## Integration Commands

### Check Integration Readiness
```bash
/integrate --check
```
- Validates all parallel tracks meet integration requirements
- Checks quality gates across all development sessions
- Verifies API contract compatibility and dependencies
- Identifies any blocking issues before integration starts
- Provides detailed readiness report with recommendations

### Start Integration Process
```bash
/integrate --start
```
- Initiates systematic integration of all ready tracks
- Creates integration branch with proper versioning
- Merges tracks in dependency order with conflict resolution
- Runs comprehensive integration test suite
- Generates integration report and deployment artifacts

### Monitor Integration Status
```bash
/integrate --status
```
- Shows real-time integration progress across all tracks
- Displays test results and quality gate status
- Provides performance metrics and error reports
- Tracks deployment readiness and rollback capabilities

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
/integrate --rollback
```
- Safely rolls back integration to last stable state
- Preserves individual track progress and development work
- Maintains git history and enables re-integration attempts
- Notifies all parallel sessions of rollback status

## Integration Strategy

### Pre-Integration Validation
```typescript
interface IntegrationChecklist {
  quality_gates: {
    test_coverage: boolean;
    security_scan: boolean;
    performance_benchmark: boolean;
    code_quality: boolean;
  };
  compatibility: {
    api_contracts: boolean;
    database_schema: boolean;
    dependency_versions: boolean;
    configuration: boolean;
  };
  readiness: {
    feature_complete: boolean;
    documentation_updated: boolean;
    deployment_ready: boolean;
    monitoring_configured: boolean;
  };
}

class IntegrationValidator {
  async validate_integration_readiness(): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    const tracks = await this.get_parallel_tracks();
    const results = [];
    
    for (const track of tracks) {
      const validation = await this.validate_track(track);
      results.push({
        track: track.name,
        status: validation.passed ? 'ready' : 'blocked',
        issues: validation.issues,
        quality_score: validation.quality_score
      });
    }
    
    return {
      overall_ready: results.every(r => r.status === 'ready'),
      track_results: results,
      integration_plan: await this.create_integration_plan(results)
    };
  }
}
```

### Dependency-Ordered Integration
```bash
# Automatically determine integration order based on dependencies
create_integration_order() {
  # Analyze cross-track dependencies
  dependencies=$(analyze_track_dependencies)
  
  # Create dependency graph
  graph=$(build_dependency_graph "$dependencies")
  
  # Calculate topological sort for integration order
  integration_order=$(topological_sort "$graph")
  
  echo "Integration order: $integration_order"
  return $integration_order
}

# Execute integration in calculated order
execute_ordered_integration() {
  local integration_order=$1
  
  for track in $integration_order; do
    echo "🔄 Integrating track: $track"
    
    # Pre-integration checks
    if ! validate_track_ready "$track"; then
      echo "❌ Track $track not ready for integration"
      return 1
    fi
    
    # Merge track
    if ! merge_track "$track"; then
      echo "❌ Failed to merge track $track"
      initiate_rollback
      return 1
    fi
    
    # Post-merge validation
    if ! validate_post_merge "$track"; then
      echo "❌ Post-merge validation failed for $track"
      initiate_rollback
      return 1
    fi
    
    echo "✅ Track $track integrated successfully"
  done
}
```

## Automated Integration Pipeline

### Continuous Integration Workflow
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for parallel track integration
name: Parallel Development Integration
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      integration_mode:
        description: 'Integration mode'
        required: true
        default: 'automatic'
        type: choice
        options:
          - automatic
          - manual-review
          - staged

jobs:
  validate-tracks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        track: [auth, api, ui, infrastructure]
    steps:
      - name: Validate track readiness
        run: |
          /integrate --check --track=${{ matrix.track }}
          
  integration:
    needs: validate-tracks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create integration environment
        run: |
          # Set up clean integration environment
          setup_integration_environment
          
      - name: Execute systematic integration
        run: |
          # Run integration with full validation
          /integrate --start --mode=${{ inputs.integration_mo
