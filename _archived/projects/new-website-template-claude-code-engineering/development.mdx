# CLAUDE.md - AI SaaS Template Project Instructions

## Project Context
This project recreates a modern AI SaaS landing page based on the Aceternity UI template at https://ai-saas-template-aceternity.vercel.app/

## Development Approach

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow functional component patterns with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)

### Component Development Rules
1. **Always check existing patterns** before creating new components
2. **Use the `cn()` utility** for className merging
3. **Implement responsive design** with mobile-first approach
4. **Add proper TypeScript types** for all props and functions
5. **Use Framer Motion** for animations consistently

### File Organization
```
components/
├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, Features, etc.)
├── animations/   # Animation wrapper components
└── layouts/      # Layout components
```

### Animation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Implement CSS transitions for simple hover effects
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Keep animations under 60fps target
- Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

### Performance Standards
- Lazy load components below the fold
- Use next/image for all images
- Implement proper loading states
- Keep bundle size under control
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for interactive components
- Test responsive breakpoints
- Verify accessibility standards
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Aceternity UI Components Implementation

When implementing Aceternity-style components:
1. Start with the basic structure
2. Add glassmorphism effects
3. Implement animations progressively
4. Ensure dark mode compatibility
5. Test on multiple devices

## Key Features to Implement

### Priority 1 (Core)
- Navigation with theme toggle
- Hero section with animations
- Feature grid with cards
- Footer with links

### Priority 2 (Enhanced)
- Moving cards carousel
- Gradient animations
- Chat interface demo
- Interactive hover effects

### Priority 3 (Polish)
- Parallax scrolling
- Background effects
- Loading animations
- Page transitions

## Command Shortcuts

```bash
# Quick commands for development
dev:        npm run dev
build:      npm run build
lint:       npm run lint:fix
format:     npm run format
check:      npm run type-check
```

## Environment Variables

Required variables (create .env.local):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION=
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deployment:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive on all devices
- [ ] SEO meta tags configured
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Animations janky on mobile
**Solution**: Reduce animation complexity, use CSS transforms

### Issue: Dark mode flash on load
**Solution**: Implement proper theme detection in _document

### Issue: Slow initial load
**Solution**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution**: Run `npm run type-check` and fix all errors

## AI Assistant Instructions

When working on this project:
1. **Always run the setup script first** if project isn't initialized
2. **Check existing components** before creating new ones
3. **Follow the implementation plan** phases in order
4. **Test on multiple screen sizes** during development
5. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
6. **Document complex logic** with comments
