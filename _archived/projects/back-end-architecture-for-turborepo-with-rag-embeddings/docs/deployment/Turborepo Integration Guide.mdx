# Turborepo Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the backend intelligence services into your existing Turborepo monorepo.

## Step 1: Add Backend as a Workspace

In your `turbo.json` file, add the `backend-architecture` directory as a new workspace:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "baseBranch": "origin/main",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "lint": {},
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  },
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*",
    "backend-architecture/apps/*",
    "backend-architecture/packages/*"
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Scripts

In your root `package.json`, add scripts to run the backend services:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:backend": "turbo run dev --filter=api-gateway...",
    "build:backend": "turbo run build --filter=api-gateway...",
    "start:backend": "turbo run start --filter=api-gateway"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the root of your Turborepo to install all dependencies for the backend services.

## Step 4: Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your Turborepo and add the necessary environment variables for the backend services. You can copy the contents of the `.env.example` file from the `backend-architecture` directory.

## Step 5: Running the Backend

To run the backend services in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

This will start the API Gateway and all dependent services. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Step 6: Building for Production

To build the backend services for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build:backend
```

This will create optimized production builds for all services.

## Step 7: Deployment

Follow the instructions in the [Deployment Guide](./deployment_guide.md) to deploy the backend services to your preferred environment.
