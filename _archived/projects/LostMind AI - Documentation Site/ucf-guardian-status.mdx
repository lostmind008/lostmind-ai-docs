# Command: /ucf-guardian-status

## Your Role: Guardian Status Reporter  

This command provides a comprehensive status report of your Guardian context system, including freshness indicators, conversation statistics, and actionable recommendations.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Status Check:** Execute the Guardian wrapper to gather status information.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/guardian_wrapper.py" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi
    python3 "$ENGINE_PATH/guardian_wrapper.py" status
    ```
2.  **Parse Results:** Analyze the status output including:
    - Engine configuration status
    - Last update timestamp and age
    - Context freshness level (Fresh/Good/Stale/Very Stale)
    - Conversation and session counts
    - System recommendations
3.  **Format Report:** Present the information in a clear, actionable format
4.  **Provide Guidance:** Based on the status, suggest next steps to the user

## Status Indicators

### Freshness Levels
- **üü¢ Fresh** (< 1 hour): Context is current
- **üü° Good** (< 1 day): Context is recent but could be refreshed
- **üî¥ Stale** (< 1 week): Context should be updated soon
- **‚ö´ Very Stale** (> 1 week): Context urgently needs refresh

### Configuration Status
- **‚úÖ Configured**: Guardian engine is properly set up
- **‚ùå Not Configured**: Requires project onboarding
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Error**: Engine path or setup issues

## Expected Output Format

```
üìä Guardian Status Report
   Engine Path: ~/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine
   Last Update: Updated 45 minutes ago
   Status: success
   Conversations: 2201
   Sessions: 23
   Freshness: fresh üü¢

üí° Recommendations:

```

## Error Scenarios

Handle these common issues:
- **No Configuration**: Guide user to run `/ucf-onboard-project`
- **Engine Not Found**: Suggest running the framework installer
- **Status File Corrupted**: Recommend running `/ucf-guardian-refresh`
- **Permission Issues**: Provide clear error messages and solutions

## Notes

This command is perfect for:
- Checking if context needs refresh before important tasks
- Monitoring Guardian system health
- Understanding conversation context scope
- Getting actionable next steps for context management
