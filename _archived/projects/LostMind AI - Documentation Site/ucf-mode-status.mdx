# Command: /ucf-mode-status

## Your Role: SDLC Mode Status Reporter

This command displays the current SDLC mode and provides context about the project's development stage and Claude's current behavioral configuration.

## Your Workflow

1. **Check Project Setup**: Verify project has been onboarded
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f ".claude/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
       echo "‚ùå No .claude/CLAUDE.md found. Please run /ucf-onboard-project first."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Read Current CLAUDE.md**: Extract the current mode information

3. **Parse Mode Section**: Look for the "CURRENT SDLC MODE" section

4. **Display Status Report**: Show comprehensive mode and project status

## Status Information to Display

### Current Mode Detection
Extract and display:
- **Current SDLC Mode**: [IDEA/DESIGN/DEV/TEST/PROD/NOT SET]
- **Mode Set**: [Timestamp when mode was last changed]
- **Mode Context**: [Description of current phase]

### Mode-Specific Status

**For IDEA Mode:**
```
üéØ IDEA Mode Active
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: Exploration and decision-making
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Research, discuss, analyze (no implementation)
   ‚Ä¢ Last Activity: [Timestamp from Guardian context]
```

**For DESIGN Mode:**
```
üèóÔ∏è DESIGN Mode Active
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: Architecture planning and technical specification
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Plan, document, verify, specify
   ‚Ä¢ Design Artifacts: [List key files created]
```

**For DEV Mode:**
```
‚öôÔ∏è DEV Mode Active
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: Active development and implementation
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Code, test, configure (full technical assistance)
   ‚Ä¢ Development Status: [Files created, features implemented]
```

**For TEST Mode:**
```
üîç TEST Mode Active
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: Quality assurance and validation
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Test, lint, secure, optimise
   ‚Ä¢ Quality Status: [Last test results summary]
```

**For PROD Mode:**
```
üöÄ PROD Mode Active
   ‚Ä¢ Focus: Production deployment preparation
   ‚Ä¢ Behavior: Maximum quality standards (zero compromise)
   ‚Ä¢ Readiness Status: [Production checklist completion]
```

### Project Health Overview

Display additional context:
- **Guardian Integration**: [Active/Inactive]
- **Last Context Update**: [Timestamp]
- **Project Type**: [Detected from PROJECT_MAP.md]
- **API Verification Status**: [Current/Needs Update]

## Expected Output Format

```
üìä SDLC Mode Status Report
========================

üéØ Current Mode: DEV
   Set: 2025-09-20 14:30:25
   Context: Active development and implementation phase

‚öôÔ∏è DEV Mode Behaviors:
   ‚Ä¢ Creating complete implementations with tests
   ‚Ä¢ Handling dependencies and setup automatically
   ‚Ä¢ Including proper error handling
   ‚Ä¢ Following quality standards
   ‚Ä¢ Filling technical implementation gaps

üìã Project Overview:
   ‚Ä¢ Guardian Context: Active (last updated 2 hours ago)
   ‚Ä¢ Project Type: AI/ML Application
   ‚Ä¢ API Verification: Current (verified today)
   ‚Ä¢ Files Modified Today: 8
   ‚Ä¢ Last Quality Check: Not run

üí° Available Mode Commands:
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-idea - Switch to exploration mode
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-design - Switch to architecture planning
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-dev - Continue development (current)
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-test - Begin quality assurance
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-prod - Prepare for production

üîÑ Next Suggested Action:
   Based on current development progress, consider running /ucf-mode-test
   to validate recent changes before continuing.
```

## Mode Recommendations

Based on detected project state, suggest appropriate mode transitions:

**If no recent activity in current mode:**
- Suggest reviewing mode appropriateness
- Recommend mode that matches current needs

**If quality issues detected:**
- Recommend switching to TEST mode
- Highlight specific issues to address

**If ready for deployment:**
- Suggest PROD mode transition
- Show production readiness checklist

## Integration Information

**Guardian Context Integration:**
- Show last context synthesis
- Display recent conversation patterns
- Indicate context freshness level

**Quality Metrics:**
- Last linting results
- Test coverage (if available)
- Dependency status
- Security scan results

## Error Handling

**If no mode is set:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No SDLC mode currently set

üéØ Available modes:
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-idea - Start with exploration
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-design - Begin architecture planning
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-dev - Jump into development
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-test - Focus on quality assurance
   ‚Ä¢ /ucf-mode-prod - Prepare for production

üí° Recommendation: Start with /ucf-mode-idea to explore your project goals
```

**If mode section is corrupted:**
```
‚ùå Mode information corrupted in .claude/CLAUDE.md

üîß To fix: Run any /ucf-mode-* command to reset mode configuration
```
