# Auto-Export Chat Management

**Command**: `/ucf-auto-export [action] [interval]`
**Purpose**: Manage automatic chat export for continuous unlimited context memory preservation

## Description

This command manages the auto-export scheduler that continuously captures Claude Code conversations to preserve the WHY behind every decision. This is critical for unlimited context memory that prevents AI drift and maintains goal alignment.

## Arguments

- `action`: `start`, `stop`, or `status`
- `interval` (optional): Hours between exports (default: 1 hour)

## Actions

### Start Auto-Export
```bash
# Start with default 1-hour interval
/ucf-auto-export start

# Start with custom interval (2 hours)
/ucf-auto-export start 2
```

**What happens:**
1. **Background Process**: Starts a daemon that monitors Claude Code activity
2. **Smart Detection**: Only triggers exports when Claude is actively being used
3. **Continuous Memory**: Automatically captures reasoning chains to prevent context decay
4. **Guardian Integration**: Each export triggers Guardian analysis for PURPOSE preservation

### Stop Auto-Export
```bash
/ucf-auto-export stop
```

**What happens:**
- Gracefully stops the background auto-export process
- Preserves all existing context data
- Clean shutdown with proper resource cleanup

### Check Status
```bash
/ucf-auto-export status
```

**What happens:**
- Shows current auto-export scheduler status (running/stopped)
- Displays configuration details (interval, project path)
- Shows recent log entries from auto-export activities
- Reports last export timestamp and success status

## Core Mission Alignment

This command directly serves the **unlimited context memory** mission by:

- **Continuous WHY Preservation**: Automatically captures the reasoning behind decisions
- **Drift Prevention**: Ensures no context decay between sessions
- **Goal Alignment**: Maintains mission focus across all AI interactions
- **Zero Manual Overhead**: Works transparently without user intervention

## Technical Implementation

The auto-export system:
1. **Activity Detection**: Monitors Claude Code processes and file changes
2. **Smart Triggering**: Only exports during active development periods
3. **Custom Export Format**: Uses our enhanced exporter with PURPOSE analysis
4. **Guardian Integration**: Automatically triggers context synthesis
5. **Persistent Logging**: Maintains detailed logs of all export activities

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start continuous context preservation
/ucf-auto-export start

# Check if auto-export is working
/ucf-auto-export status

# Change to 30-minute intervals for intensive projects
/ucf-auto-export stop
/ucf-auto-export start 0.5

# Stop when project work is complete
/ucf-auto-export stop
```

## Files Created

- `.lostmind_ai_context/auto_export_config.json` - Scheduler configuration
- `.lostmind_ai_context/auto_export.pid` - Process tracking
- `.lostmind_ai_context/auto_export.log` - Activity logs
- `.lostmind_ai_context/current_session_export_*.txt` - Exported sessions

## Integration Benefits

When combined with Guardian:
- **Real-time Context Synthesis**: Every export triggers Guardian analysis
- **PURPOSE Enhancement**: Automatic reasoning chain preservation
- **Goal Tracking**: Continuous alignment verification
- **Historical Continuity**: Seamless context flow across all sessions
