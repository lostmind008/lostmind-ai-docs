# This prompt instructs the agent to create the initial project structure
# after the core protocols have been defined.

Our project has now been defined in the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file.

Your task is to scaffold the initial directory structure and create the necessary configuration files based on the "Technical Specification" protocol.

Please begin the development workflow.
