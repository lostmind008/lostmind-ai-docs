# MCP Tools Configuration for Claude Code

This guide explains how to configure and integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools with Claude Code.

## Understanding MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between AI models like Claude and external tools, services, and data sources. It provides a standardized way for Claude to interact with your development environment, files, databases, and other resources.

## Methods for Configuring MCP Tools

There are two main approaches to configuring MCP tools with Claude Code:

### 1. CLI Wizard Approach (Official Method)

Claude Code offers a built-in CLI wizard for adding MCP tools:

```bash
# Add an MCP tool using the wizard
claude mcp add <name>
```

The wizard will guide you through setting up each tool step by step. While this is the officially documented approach, many users find it cumbersome for complex configurations.

### 2. Configuration File Approach (Community Preferred)

A more efficient approach for managing multiple MCP tools is to edit the configuration file directly:

1. Find your Claude Code configuration directory:
   - macOS: `~/.config/claude-code/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/claude-code/`
   - Windows (WSL): `~/.config/claude-code/`

2. Edit the MCP configuration file:
   ```bash
   # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code
   
   # Create or edit the config.json file
   nano ~/.config/claude-code/config.json
   ```

3. Add your MCP tool configurations in JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "servers": [
         {
           "name": "filesystem",
           "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers filesystem",
           "env": {},
           "args": ["--tools", "read_file,write_file,edit_file,list_directory,create_directory,search_files"]
         },
         {
           "name": "terminal",
           "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers terminal",
           "env": {},
           "args": []
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## Common MCP Tool Configurations

### File System Access

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers filesystem",
  "env": {},
  "args": [
    "--tools", 
    "read_file,write_file,edit_file,list_directory,create_directory,search_files,get_file_info"
  ]
}
```

### Terminal Access

```json
{
  "name": "terminal",
  "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers terminal",
  "env": {},
  "args": []
}
```

### Git Integration

```json
{
  "name": "git",
  "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers git",
  "env": {},
  "args": []
}
```

### Database Access (SQLite Example)

```json
{
  "name": "sqlite",
  "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers sqlite",
  "env": {},
  "args": ["--database", "/path/to/your/database.sqlite"]
}
```

### Web Browser Control (Puppeteer)

```json
{
  "name": "puppeteer",
  "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers puppeteer",
  "env": {},
  "args": []
}
```

## Verifying MCP Tool Configuration

After configuring your MCP tools, restart Claude Code and verify that the tools are loaded:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Once launched, you should see an MCP tools icon indicating that your tools are available
# You can also check available tools with:
/available-tools
```

## Managing MCP Tool Permissions

Claude Code has a built-in allowlist system for controlling which tools Claude can use without explicit permission:

```bash
# View and modify the allowlist
/allowed-tools

# Examples:
# Allow file edits
/allowed-tools add Edit

# Allow git commits
/allowed-tools add Bash(git commit:*)

# Allow web navigation
/allowed-tools add mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate
```

## Troubleshooting MCP Tool Integration

### Tool Not Appearing

If an MCP tool doesn't appear in the available tools list:

1. Verify the configuration syntax in your config.json file
2. Ensure that the required npm packages are installed
3. Check for error messages when Claude Code starts
4. Try running the MCP server command manually to check for errors

### Permission Issues

If Claude doesn't have permission to use a tool:

1. Use `/allowed-tools add <tool>` to add it to the allowlist
2. For filesystem operations, ensure Claude has access to the directories it needs
3. For git operations, ensure your git configuration is correct

### Connection Issues

If Claude cannot connect to an MCP server:

1. Check that the server is running
2. Verify port configurations
3. Check for network issues or firewall settings
4. Restart the MCP server and Claude Code

## Advanced MCP Tool Configuration

### Custom Environment Variables

You can pass environment variables to MCP servers:

```json
{
  "name": "custom-server",
  "command": "npx my-custom-mcp-server",
  "env": {
    "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
    "DEBUG": "true"
  },
  "args": []
}
```

### Custom MCP Servers

To use a custom MCP server:

1. Install the server package:
   ```bash
   npm install -g my-custom-mcp-ser
