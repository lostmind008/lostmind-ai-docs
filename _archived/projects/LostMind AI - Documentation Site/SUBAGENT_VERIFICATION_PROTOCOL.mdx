# SUBAGENT VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

## üö® MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS

**EVERY SUBAGENT OUTPUT MUST PASS ALL VERIFICATION STEPS BEFORE ACCEPTANCE**

### API Key for Testing
```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 1. BASIC FUNCTIONALITY CHECK
```bash
cd "/Users/sumitm1/Documents/myproject/Ongoing Projects/new ai scraper agent"

# Virtual environment MUST exist and work
if [ -d "venv" ]; then
    source venv/bin/activate
    echo "‚úÖ Virtual environment activated"
else
    echo "‚ùå Virtual environment missing - CRITICAL FAILURE"
    exit 1
fi

# Dependencies MUST install correctly
pip install -r requirements.txt || echo "‚ùå Dependencies failed"

# Code MUST compile and import
python -c "
try:
    from enhanced_orchestrator.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent
    print('‚úÖ BaseAgent imports')
except Exception as e:
    print('‚ùå BaseAgent failed:', e)
"
```

### 2. API INTEGRATION CHECK
```bash
# API key MUST work with google-genai SDK
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY_HERE"

python -c "
import google.genai as genai
genai.configure(api_key='YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY_HERE')
print('‚úÖ API key configured successfully')

# Test basic model access
try:
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.5-flash')
    print('‚úÖ Model access successful')
except Exception as e:
    print('‚ùå Model access failed:', e)
"
```

### 3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All imports work correctly  
- [ ] Virtual environment configured
- [ ] Dependencies install successfully
- [ ] API key integration works
- [ ] Basic functionality demonstrates
- [ ] No critical TODO/FIXME markers
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Meets client performance requirements

### 4. PROGRESS TRACKING
- Update CLIENT_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md ONLY after verification passes
- Mark todos complete ONLY after full verification
- Document issues honestly, never claim false completion

### 5. REJECTION CRITERIA
**IMMEDIATE REJECTION IF:**
- Code doesn't compile
- Imports fail
- Virtual environment not used
- API key integration broken
- Missing basic error handling
- False completion claims

## VERIFICATION COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITY
**I (Claude Code orchestrator) MUST:**
1. Run ALL verification steps before accepting work
2. Test with provided API key
3. Update progress tracking honestly
4. Never accept incomplete work
5. Create working application, not just documentation
