# 🗺️ LostMind AI TurboRepo - Honest Roadmap

> **Last Updated**: September 17, 2025
> **Status**: Reality-based planning (no aspirational claims)
> **Current Phase**: Professional Infrastructure Setup

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Transform the existing TurboRepo foundation into a professional-grade platform ready for external collaboration, then systematically migrate and monetize external services.

## 📊 Current Reality Check

### What We Have Today

- ✅ Basic TurboRepo structure
- ✅ 1 working FastAPI service (ai-compute)
- ✅ 2 Next.js apps (basic scaffolds)
- ✅ 7 packages (varying completion)
- ❌ No tests, no deployment, no external services migrated

### What We're Building Toward

- Professional development environment
- Test-driven development
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Systematic service migration
- Actual revenue generation

## 🏗️ Development Phases

### Phase 0: Emergency Professional Setup ⏳ (Week 1)

**Goal**: Make repository ready for any professional team to contribute
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

#### Completed ✅

- Professional task documentation (tasks02.md)
- Environment separation (dev/test/staging)
- Docker infrastructure
- Dependabot management

#### In Progress 🔄

- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md guide
- [ ] Test infrastructure setup
- [ ] Documentation reality check

#### Success Criteria

- Any developer can `git clone` → `docker-compose up` → working environment
- CI/CD pipeline is green
- Documentation is honest about current state

---

### Phase 1: Quality Foundation (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Establish professional code quality standards

#### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] Unit test framework setup (Vitest)
- [ ] Integration test framework (Playwright)
- [ ] Test database configuration
- [ ] CI/CD test execution

#### Code Quality

- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI)
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
- [ ] Automated quality gates

#### Deployment Pipeline

- [ ] Staging environment setup
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Rollback capabilities

#### Success Criteria

- > 80% test coverage for all packages
- Automated staging deployments
- API documentation available
- Security scanning in CI

---

### Phase 2: External Service Assessment (Week 4)

**Goal**: Understand and prioritize external services for migration

#### Service Discovery

- [ ] Catalog all external services in `/Users/sumitm1/Documents/New Ongoing Projects/`
- [ ] Assess each service's code quality and completeness
- [ ] Document actual functionality (not aspirational)
- [ ] Estimate migration effort realistically

#### Priority Matrix

- [ ] Revenue potential (realistic estimates)

- [ ] Define success criteria for each
- [ ] Estimate realistic timelines
- [ ] Plan integration patterns

#### Success Criteria

- Complete inventory of migratable services
- Evidence-based priority ranking
- Detailed migration plans for top 3 services

---

### Phase 3: First Service Migration (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal**: Successfully migrate and deploy one external service

#### Target Service Selection

Based on Phase 2 assessment, likely candidates:

- **LostMind AI - Advanced Media Converter** (if technically sound)
