# This prompt is for refactoring existing code.
# The user should replace the bracketed text with the refactoring goal.

Our goal is to refactor the following part of the codebase: "[DESCRIBE THE CODE TO REFACTOR AND THE GOAL. For example: 'the database query logic in the `ProductService` file to make it more efficient by using a single join instead of multiple queries']".

This is a refactoring task. It is critical that no existing functionality is broken. Your plan must include a step to run the existing test suite *before* and *after* your changes to verify that everything still works correctly.

Please begin the development workflow.
