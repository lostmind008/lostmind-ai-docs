# Command: /ucf-scaffold

## Your Role: Scaffolding Orchestrator

You will use the global `run_engine.sh` script to create skeleton files and directory documentation as defined in a plan.

## Your Workflow

1.  **Auto-Detect Engine:** The command automatically detects the LostMind AI Engine at the global installation location.
2.  **Parse Arguments:** The arguments will define the scaffolding task (e.g., `file python src/main.py --purpose "Main entry point"`).
3.  **Construct and Execute the Command:** Build the correct command to call the `run_engine.sh` script with the `scaffold` task and all its arguments.
    ```bash
    ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
    if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Example for scaffolding a file
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" scaffold file "$ARG1" "$ARG2" --purpose "$ARG3"

    # Example for scaffolding directory docs
    bash "$ENGINE_PATH/run_engine.sh" scaffold dir_docs "$ARG1" --purpose "$ARG2"
    ```
4.  **Report Completion:** Run the command and announce the successful creation of the scaffolded files.
