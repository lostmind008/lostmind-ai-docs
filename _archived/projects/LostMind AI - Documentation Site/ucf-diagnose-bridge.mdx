# Command: /ucf-diagnose-bridge

## Purpose
Print how the framework hub is being resolved (env/config/fallback) and verify core importability.

## Steps
1. Run the diagnosis script:
```bash
ENGINE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/lostmind_ai_engine"
if [ ! -f "$ENGINE_PATH/diagnose_bridge.py" ]; then
    echo "❌ LostMind AI engine not found. Please run the framework installer."
    exit 1
fi
python3 "$ENGINE_PATH/diagnose_bridge.py"
```
2. Review output to confirm the chosen path and that `context_guardian` is importable.

## Expected Output
```
Bridge Resolution Diagnosis:
- env              -> /abs/path/to/framework_hub [OK]
- project_config   -> /path/to/project/framework_hub [MISS]
- cwd_framework_hub-> /current/project/framework_hub [MISS]
- repo_neighbor    -> /repo/framework_hub [MISS]

✅ Using: /abs/path/to/framework_hub (source: env)
✅ context_guardian importable
```

## Troubleshooting
- Set env var: `export LOSTMIND_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/abs/path/to/framework_hub`
- Or create `lostmind_framework_config.json` with `{ "framework_hub_path": "/abs/path" }` in project root.
