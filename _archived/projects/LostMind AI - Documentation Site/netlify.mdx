To deploy next-forge on Netlify, you need to create 3 new projects for the `app`, `api` and `web` apps. After selecting your repository, change the "Site to deploy" selection to the app of choice e.g. `apps/app`. This should automatically detect the Next.js setup and as such, the build command and output directory.

Then, add all your environment variables to the project.

Finally, just hit "Deploy" and Netlify will take care of the rest!

## Environment variables

If you're deploying on Netlify, we recommend making use of the Shared Environment Variables feature. Variables used by libraries need to exist in all packages and duplicating them can be a headache. Learn more about how [environment variables](/docs/setup/env) work in next-forge.
