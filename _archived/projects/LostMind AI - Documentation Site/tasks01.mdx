Title: Emergency Professionalization for External Collaboration

Goal

Make repository ready for professional development teams (OpenAI, Devin AI, external developers) by establishing minimal professional standards and fixing documentation that misrepresents project state.

Background

Current state analysis reveals significant gaps between documentation claims and reality:

DOCUMENTATION CLAIMS vs REALITY:

- Claims "9 services worth $2.3M ARR" → Services exist in external directories, NOT migrated
- Claims "production-ready" → Missing Docker, environments, deployment pipeline
- Claims "enterprise-grade" → No test files, no staging/prod separation
- Claims "investor-ready" → Missing basic professional development setup

CRITICAL COLLABORATION BLOCKERS:

- 8 failing Dependabot PRs causing CI failures
- No Docker/containerization for consistent development
- No environment separation (only .env.example exists)
- No test infrastructure (zero test files)
- No deployment pipeline (CI only builds)
- No onboarding documentation
- No API documentation

Any professional development team attempting to contribute would face immediate blockers preventing effective collaboration.

Tasks

1. Fix CI/CD Pipeline and Dependabot Issues
   - Close risky major version bump PRs: #33, #34, #36, #37, #38
   - Auto-merge safe type definition updates: #51, #53
   - Create .github/dependabot.yml with weekly schedule and PR limits
   - Verify CI pipeline is green after cleanup

2. Create Professional Environment Structure
   - Set up .env.development with proper development configurations
   - Create .env.test for test environment
   - Create .env.staging for staging environment
   - Document environment variables in environments/README.md
   - Add .env.\* to .gitignore if not already present

3. Establish Docker Infrastructure
   - Create infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.node for Next.js applications
   - Create infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.python for FastAPI services
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development stack
   - Add .dockerignore file with appropriate exclusions
   - Test full stack starts with single command: docker-compose up

4. Set Up Basic Test Infrastructure
   - Create tests/ directory structure (unit/, integration/, e2e/, fixtures/)
   - Add test scripts to root package.json
   - Configure test environment variables
   - Create sample test file to verify testing framework works

5. Create Professional Onboarding Documentation
   - Write CONTRIBUTING.md with clear setup instructions
   - Create infrastructure/README.md explaining Docker setup
   - Update root README.md with accurate quick start guide
   - Remove aspirational claims, mark planned features as "PLANNED"

6. Document Reality vs Plans
   - Create docs/reality/ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATE.md with honest assessment
   - Mark all unimplemented features as "PLANNED" in existing docs
   - Remove revenue projections not backed by implemented code
   - Create ROADMAP.md showing actual next steps

7. Verify Professional Setup
   - Test that new developer can clone and run project in < 10 minutes
   - Verify all environments work correctly
   - Confirm CI/CD pipeline passes
   - Ensure Docker development environment is functional

Acceptance Criteria

- CI/CD pipeline shows GREEN status (no failing builds)
- Any developer can clone repository and run `docker-compose up` to get working environment
- All environment configurations (.env.development, .env.test, .env.staging) exist and are documented
- CONTRIBUTING.md provides clear, accurate setup instructions
- Documentation honestly represents current state vs future plans
- Test infrastructure is established and functional
- Repository is ready for external professional development team collaboration
- Dependabot PRs are manageable (< 5 open, weekly schedule)

Constraints

- Minimal diffs: Focus only on professional infrastructure, avoid repo-wide refactors
- Do not add new dependencies unless explicitly required for professional setup
- Follow existing project patterns and configurations where possible
- Maintain all existing functionality while improving infrastructure
- Keep changes focused on collaboration enablement, not feature development
