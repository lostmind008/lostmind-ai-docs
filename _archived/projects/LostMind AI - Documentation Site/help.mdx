# Command: /help

## Your Task

When the user runs `/help`, you will analyze the current state of the project and provide a concise list of recommended next steps.

### Your Analysis Workflow:

1.  **Check for Framework:** First, check if the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file exists.
    *   If **not**, your only suggestion should be: "The Universal Claude Framework is not installed in this project. Run `/init` for a new project or `/audit` for an existing one."

2.  **Read Project State:** If the framework is installed, read the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `state/audit_report.md` (if it exists).

3.  **Provide Dynamic Suggestions:** Based on the state, generate a list of 3-4 helpful, actionable suggestions.

### Example Scenarios:

*   **Freshly Initialized Project:** Suggest beginning the brainstorming session.
*   **Project Defined, No Code Written:** Suggest scaffolding the basic application structure.
*   **Audited Project with Gaps:** Suggest addressing the first recommendation from the audit report.
*   **Project in Progress:** Suggest adding a new feature or writing integration tests.
