# This prompt is for writing documentation.
# The user should replace the bracketed text with the documentation goal.

Our goal is to write documentation for the following: "[DESCRIBE THE AREA TO DOCUMENT. For example: 'the user authentication API endpoints, creating a clear guide for third-party developers in the main README.md']".

This is a documentation task. Your plan should focus on reading the relevant source code to understand the functionality and then generating clear, concise, and accurate documentation.

Please begin the development workflow.
