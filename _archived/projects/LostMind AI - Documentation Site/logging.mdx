The logging functionality is abstracted through a simple wrapper that provides a consistent logging interface across environments.

## How it works

In development, logs are output to the console for easy debugging. In production, logs are sent to BetterStack Logs where they can be searched, filtered, and analyzed.

## Usage

To use this logging setup, simply import and use the `log` object. It shares the same interface as the `console` object, so you can replace `console` with `log` in your codebase.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { log } from '@repo/observability/log';

log.info('Hello, world!');
```
