# Common Issues and Solutions for Claude Code

This guide addresses frequently encountered issues with Claude Code and MCP tool integration, based on community feedback and official troubleshooting advice.

## Installation Issues

### Node.js Version Incompatibility

**Issue:** Claude Code installation fails due to Node.js version requirements.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your Node.js version:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
2. If below version 18, upgrade using one of these methods:
   ```bash
   # Using nvm (recommended)
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   
   # Direct installation
   # For macOS:
   brew install node@18
   
   # For Ubuntu/Debian:
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```
3. Reinstall Claude Code:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

### Permission Errors During Installation

**Issue:** EACCES permission errors when installing globally.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create a directory for global packages
mkdir ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use this directory
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'

# Add to PATH in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc:
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install without sudo
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Auto-Updater Issues

**Issue:** Claude Code auto-updater fails or shows errors.

**Solution:**
1. Manually update Claude Code:
   ```bash
   npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
2. If that fails, try reinstalling:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
3. For persistent issues, check the npm global prefix directory permissions:
   ```bash
   # Find your npm global prefix
   npm config get prefix
   
   # Ensure you have write permissions to that directory
   ls -la $(npm config get prefix)
   
   # Fix permissions if needed
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)
   ```

## MCP Tool Integration Issues

### MCP Tools Not Appearing

**Issue:** Configured MCP tools don't appear in Claude Code.

**Solutions:**

1. Verify MCP server installation:
   ```bash
   # Check if the MCP package is installed
   npm list -g | grep modelcontextprotocol
   
   # Install if missing
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/servers
   ```

2. Check configuration syntax:
   - Ensure your config.json file has proper JSON formatting
   - Verify that the "mcp" section and "servers" array are correctly structured

3. Run MCP servers manually to check for errors:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers filesystem
   ```
   If you see errors, address them based on the specific message.

4. Restart Claude Code after making configuration changes:
   ```bash
   # Close existing sessions and start fresh
   claude
   ```

### AMD CPU Compatibility Issues

**Issue:** Installation fails on AMD Ryzen processors.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're using Node.js version 18 specifically (not newer)
2. For Windows users, install via WSL2:
   ```bash
   # Install in WSL2 Ubuntu environment
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
3. Some users have reported success by using nvm to manage Node.js:
   ```bash
   nvm install 18.18.0
   nvm use 18.18.0
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

### MCP Connection Errors

**Issue:** Claude Code fails to connect to MCP servers.

**Solutions:**
1. Check for port conflicts:
   ```bash
   # Check if anything is using the default MCP port (often 8080)
   lsof -i :8080
   
   # If there's a conflict, terminate the process or change the port in your MCP config
   ```

2. Verify network permissions:
   - Check firewall settings if applicable
   - Ensure localhost connections are allowed

3. For WSL2 users:
   - Enable WSL integration in Windows Firewall
   - Ensure proper network connectivity between Windows and WSL

### File System Access Issues

**Issue:** Claude cannot access files or directories.

**Solutions:**
1. Check file system permissions:
   ```bash
   # Ensure Claude has read/write access to the directories you want it to work with
   ls -la /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Explicitly specify allowed directories in your MCP config:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "filesystem",
     "command": "npx @modelcontextprotocol/servers filesystem",
     "env": {},
     "args": [
       "--allowedDirectories", 
       "/path/to/your/project,/another/path"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. For the edit_file tool not appearing:
   - Make sure to include it explicitly in the tools list:
   ```json
   "args": ["--tools", "read_file,write_file,edit_file,list_directory,create_directory"]
   ```

## Authentication Issues

### OAuth Authentication Fails

**Issue:** Cannot complete OAuth process during first-time setup.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have an active Anthropic account with billing enabled
2. Clear browser cookies and cache, then try again
3. Check for browser extensions that might block redirects
4. Try usin
