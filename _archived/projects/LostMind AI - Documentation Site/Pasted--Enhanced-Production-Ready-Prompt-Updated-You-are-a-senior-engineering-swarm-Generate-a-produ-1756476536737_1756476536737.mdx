### Enhanced Production-Ready Prompt (Updated)

You are a senior engineering swarm. Generate a production-grade Turborepo for “ChatCrawler” by LostMindAI. The core of this project is a modern, server-first, type-safe stack for performance, scalability, and developer experience in late 2025 and beyond. Implement an MVP with scraping, parsing, RAG/CAG chat, visualisation, Stripe billing in AUD (weekly/monthly/yearly), credits metering, and admin analytics. Use Australian English and `dd MMM yyyy` dates. Do not ask questions; make reasonable choices and document them.

#### Guiding Principles & Technology Philosophy
- **Frontend excellence:** **Next.js 15 App Router** with Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers only (no legacy `/pages`). Embrace server-first patterns.
- **Backend services:** **FastAPI (Python 3.10+)** with Pydantic v2 for validation; fully async where possible.
- **Unified AI integration (MANDATORY):** Use the **Google Generative AI SDK** as the single interface for both Gemini Developer API and Vertex AI (code should run on both with minimal changes).
- **Type-safe data layer:** **Prisma** as ORM for PostgreSQL. Enable **pgvector** for embeddings to support the LangChain RAG option.
- **Auth:** **Auth.js v5** with JWT sessions; practical RBAC for `free | pro | enterprise`.
- **Infra defaults:** Vercel for web apps; Cloud Run for workers and webhooks; Google Secret Manager for secrets; ADC in production.

#### PRIMARY OUTCOME
- Working monorepo deployable today: Vercel (apps) + Cloud Run (services).
- Smooth chat UX like Vercel’s AI SDK templates (streaming, optimistic UI), plus a **Canvas** panel for artifact interaction (premium only).
- Dual RAG backend (**LangChain** with pgvector **OR** **Vertex AI RAG**) behind a single provider interface; automatic **CAG vs RAG** switching with caching.
- Stripe subscriptions + metered credits; customer portal; invoices; webhook; admin dashboard.

#### FRONTEND (Next.js 15, App Router, TS)
- **marketing**
  - Full SEO: `metadata.ts`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, OG images, canonical tags.
  - Pricing with AUD **weekly/monthly/yearly** toggles; checkout via **Server Action**.
  - “Ask LostMindAI” widget slot to embed `ask.lostmindai.com` or local assistant route.
- **chatcrawler**
  - **Auth.js v5** (email + Google) with JWT sessions; middleware-based RBAC.
  - Dashboard: credits balance, usage graph, recent jobs, quick actions.
  - Scrape: URL input → queue → status → cleaned HTML/Markdown preview; robots.txt respect.
  - Upload: drag & drop zip/single files; filetype detection; parser plan preview.
  - Chat (Vercel AI SDK):
    - Left: document set selector (scraped + uploaded).
    - Middle: streaming chat (slash commands: `/summarise`, `/diagram`, `/export`).
    - Right **Canvas** (premium): live artifact preview (Mermaid + React Flow), export PNG/SVG/JSON.
  - Account: invoices, portal link, cancel/upgrade, credit top-ups.

#### BACKEND/APIs
- Next.js **Route Handlers** for light endpoints (auth state, job list, signed URLs).
- **Worker (FastAPI on Cloud Run):**
  - `POST /scrape { url }`  → respects robots.txt; rate-limited; snapshot to cleaned Markdown.
  - `POST /upload { files }` → unpack→detect→parse; normalise to IR; persist.
  - `POST /index { doc_ids[] }` → embeddings & store (pgvector) **or** Vertex index.
  - `POST /chat { message, doc_scope?, mode?(auto|cag|rag) }` → CAG/RAG engine.
  - `POST /visualise { ir }` → { mermaid, reactflow } JSON.
  - `GET  /jobs/:id` → status & res
