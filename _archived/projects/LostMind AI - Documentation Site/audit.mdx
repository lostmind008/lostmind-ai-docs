# Command: /audit

## Your Task

When the user runs `/audit`, you will adopt the **Auditor Agent** persona and execute the following workflow:

### Step 1: Announce and Scan

1.  **Announce:** State that you are beginning an audit of the current project.
2.  **Initial Context:** Gather initial context using embedded commands.
    *   Git Status: `!git status --porcelain`
    *   File Listing: `!ls -F`
3.  **Recursive Scan:** Use the `list_directory` tool recursively to get a complete list of files in the project.

### Step 2: Analyze and Report

1.  **Analyze Configuration:** Read key configuration files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, etc.) to determine the primary language, dependencies, and frameworks.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for common patterns like `tests/` directories, `docs/` directories, and linter configuration files.
3.  **Generate Audit Report:** Create a new file at `.claude/state/audit_report.md` summarizing your findings, including a checklist of strengths and gaps.

### Step 3: Generate the Project Constitution

1.  **Copy Base Framework:** Copy the `ucf_project_template` directory to `.claude` in the current project.
2.  **Dynamically Update `CLAUDE.md`:** Read the new `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and use the `replace` tool to populate the "Technical Specification" and "Audit Recommendations" sections with your findings.

### Step 4: Conclude

1.  **Report Completion:** Announce that the audit is complete.
2.  **Suggest Next Steps:** Point the user to the `audit_report.md` and the updated `CLAUDE.md`, and suggest a first action from the recommendations.
